# Introduction & context - Food production & food availability at a global & regional scales

- 2050 food demand projection including climate change uncertainty: increase between 30% and 62% (van Dijk et al., 2021)
- meat consumption is also projected to increase by 3% (per capita meat consumption) in Western countries even if the populations are already reaching a level which is harmful for their health (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012)
- sustainable intensification has been presented as a solution to be able to fulfill the food production objectives (should look at: Godfray and Garnett, 2014; Cassman and Grassini, 2020) + short description of what sustainable intensification is (optimisation production, crop-based, biotech...)
- however, increasing the food production in some European countries to the FAO objective (+ 10%) would not even be possible even if all the semi-natural habitats were converted into croplands, as for example in Germany, Italy and Austria (Jeanneret et al., 2021)
- there are also limits to the crop-based approach:
    - from 1961 to 2009 (~50 years), the percentage of calories from crop production consumed as food decreased from 57% to 51% (West et al., 2014)
    - in Western countries, only 40% of crops are used for direct food production (Foley at al., 2011)
    - on the other hand, animal product has become the food category which accounts for the largest land use (38% in 2005 against 35% in 1963) compared to cereals (31% in 2005 against 40% in 1963). Half of the total cropland requirement increase is due to growing land demand for animal products (Kastner et al., 2012)
    - there are unfortunately lots of waste in the process, as about 89% of the crop calories produced for animal feeds are lost, which makes that only 4% of the produced calories available to humans are in the form of animal products (Cassidy et al., 2013)
    - a production-based strategy will also have a high environmental impact, including land degradation and biodiversity loss (Hunter et al., 2017 + some others)
- It is therefore more a question of food availability than food production, especially in the Western countries: optimising land use in the Northern hemisphere could reduce the impact in tropical zones on top of preserving local biodiversity  and cultural landscape, by switching from a grain-fed to pasture-fed animals (Foley et al., 2011)
- To counteract the current trend where land use is driven by market and technology instead of local environmental conditions and population needs, there is need for multifunctional use of the land and landscape planning (Jongman, 2002)
- This would need both regional and global collaboration, as 60% and 88% of biodiversity loss projection would be avoided under national and global optimisation scenarii respectively (Egli et al., 2018)
- UNESCO MAB - Biosphere Reserve network as a great playground to experiment regional landscape planning & develop international collaboration ;-)
- maybe need to develop slightly on SDGs & 2030 Agenda
- Some examples here + blabla on us

# Small-scale grazing systems and cultural landscape

## Cultural landscapes and traditional agriculture

- European cultural landscape is a complex & intertwined network of mosaics resulting from a multi-layered historical use (Vos and Meekes, 1999)
- Categorisation of cultural landscape by the World Heritage Convention (see  Phillips, 1998)
- With time, the primary role of agricultural areas, which represented the main labour supplier for food production, has declined at the same time as new demands have raised, such as recreation & nature conservation (vos and Meekes, 1999)
- "Traditional" grazing should not be characterized per se as low-intensity, especially in highly populated areas, though high biodiversity can still be hosted thanks to many nutrient & input gradients at local & regional scales (Plieninger et al., 2006)
- Low-intensity farmlands are characterized by low nutrient inputs & low output per hectare (Bignal and McCracken, 1996)
- Traditional farming has shaped the landscape through involution (Vos and Meekes, 1999), by adapting management practices to natural environment (Bignal and McCracken), in opposition to conventional agriculture which "replace" existing landscapes thanks to technological advances which give control over natural conditions

## Biodiversity associated with low-intensity grazing systems & current trends

- All remaining high nature conservation value grazzlands across Europe associated with low-intensity livestock systems (Bignal and McCracken, 1996)
- [need some examples here, like threatened (or not) species associated with open landscape (e.g. birds, butterflies)]
- However the areas under permanent meadows and pastures have declined during the past 60 years. The trends is particularly sharp in Europe, which suffered from a 56% decrease, from 402 000 ha in 1961 to 177 000 ha in 2020 (FAO DATA, 2020)
- Principal threats are agriculture intensification and land abandonment (Bignal and McCracken, 1996), which lead to the homogenisation of the European agricultural landscape by the loss of regional biological and cultural diversity (Jongman, 2002)
- Semi-natural habitats such as Northern meadows or Fennoscandian pastures are fully dependent on agricultural management (Halada et al., 2011)
- Agricultural habitats have on average a poorer conservation status compared to other habitats (Halada et al., 2011)
- Past land use changes have already led to an estimated loss of 13.6% terrestrial "within-sample" (?) species richness, and worst-case scenario would lead to a reduction of 77% by 2100 (Newbold et al., 2015)


## Western Norway and Nordhordland Biosphere Reserve context

- [Land use history in Western Norway - (Bakka and Kaland, 1971; Hamre et al., 2007; Hjelle et al., 2006)]
- How grazing systems in Western Norway respond to traditional land use principles (Plieninger et al., 2006):
    - Multiple use: farmers usually have a mixed system, with livestock, forest & crop (can rely on some examples from gårdskart)
    - Rotational use: inmark/utmark, also rotations between fields in the same area & between animals
    - Recycling: low nutrient inputs, again inmark/utmark process
    - Low-energy economy: small-scale farming, not much mechanical interference
    - Spatial fuzziness: interactions between different land use structures (e.g. grassland & forest) and processes
- [Here I should develop more about heathlands & the utmark system, with literature from Vigdis & Inger & Kari Hjelle]
- [Paragraph should close with NBR]

# Diversity and functionality across scale

## When farmers shape the landscape matrix biodiversity

### The agricultural landscape matrix and the farm 

- [AAAALL the literature on mixed grazing systems & landscape drivers]
    - (Seibold et al., 2019)
    - Land use & microrelief drivers of plant diversity at bigger scales, from 0.1 m2 to 100 m2 (Turtureanu et al., 2014)
    - Historical patch size stronger predictor of diversity than current one; specialist richness increases with amount of extensively used landscape elements; overall species richness increased with patch heterogeneity & % agricultural matrix (Zulka et al., 2014)
    - Local environmental variables & biogeographic composition accounted for largest fractions of variability in plant species richness (Reitalu et al., 2014)

### PAPER III ("NBR-grazers") - When the farmer unintentionnally creates and interacts with the mosaic

- Background: grazing systems in Western Norway result from long-term land use at small-scale and low-intensity. 
- Many drivers from different scales can affect plant and arthropod communities: the landscape elements, the grazing management, and the in-field ecological conditions
- Particularity of Western Norway compared to other European sites: fjord system with humid climate -> the mosaic is not only horizontal but also vertical, with importance of micro-climate and natural (elevation, fjord arm) boundaries
- Most studies have looked to plant diversity, some to arthropod diversity, but only very few to community composition

### PAPER I ("ØY") - When the farmer intentionally creates the mosaic

- [ALL the literature relation to heathland burning]

## Functionality of the field system

### PAPER IV ("SHEEP") - Within the field

- Broad question: what are the dynamics between the animal and the system in outfields VS infields

![Paper IV concept](C:\Users\mke081\Documents\TheseTRADMOD\WP2_Grazing\03_PAPERS-3-4_Survey\31_Redaction\SheepField_concept.png)

### PAPER II ("MORGANE D") - From functions to services

- [ALL ES/EF literature from SLU courses]

## Methodology point here

- multidiversity and multifunctionality literature (Biodiversity Exploratories people in Germany)
- assessing system functions: trade-off between complex modelling and use of simplified proxy calculation
- ! careful with definitions between EF & ES -> use literature from SLU courses
- all critiques, limits and gaps (not lacking haha)
