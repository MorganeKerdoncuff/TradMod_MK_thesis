title: "Response to the evaluation report of the PhD thesis"

I thank the committee for providing valuable insights for the revision of my PhD thesis, and I deliver thereafter my response to their comments.

**(1) Conclusions must be supported by the data presented in the thesis**

- Example sentence in abstract: 
*Overall, I demonstrated that domestic grazing and complementary land uses in the Nordhorldand UNESCO Biosphere Reserve promoted biodiversity and the delivery of multiple ecosystem services across the fjord agroecological landscape.*
- Potential section in conclusion: 
*We showed that grazing management adapted to the capacity of ecosystems allows the spontaneous expression of natural communities (**paper III**), favouring the functional complementarity between semi-natural habitats (**paper IV**)*.
*As such, low-intensity domestic grazing supported plant diversity and synergies between forage and nectar resources in semi-natural grasslands, independently of the livestock type and the farm structure (**paper II**)*.
- What I understand: as we did not test "grazing management" as a treatment against no grazing, I cannot assure that "grazing" did this or that.
- What I should do instead: use as much as possible "grazed habitats" (what we actually investigated) and be as specific as possible on the actual papers' outcomes.
- Abstract: "Overall, I demonstrated that semi-natural grasslands and heathlands in the NBR were species-rich habitats, which supported the delivery of multiple ecosystem services across the fjord landscape"
- Conclusion: "We showed that the fine-scale environment was the most important factor influencing the composition of dominant plant assemblages in semi-natural grasslands (**paper III**), and that neither livestock type or stocking density showed clear effect on diversity or functional composition (**paper II**). This suggests that grazing pressure does not override inherent environmental variability of the ecosystem. We also showed synergies between forage and nectar resources in semi-natural grasslands (**paper II**), and that semi-natural grasslands and heathlands supported the delivery of complementary ecosystem services (**paper IV**). These findings add to the evidence that win-win strategies promoting biodiversity and multifunctionality in agroecological landscapes are already within our reach."

**(2) Key concepts must be introduced (e.g. ecosystem services, multifunctionality)**

- New introductory section after *"A new paradigm to address the global food security challenge"* (renamed "Livestock's part in the global food security challenge")
- *"From productivist agriculture to multifunctional agroecological systems"* (draft)
- For the past decades, a new dominant paradigm has acknowledged the synergy between food security, ecosystem integrity and human well-being, from/including work based on the ecosystem service framework [@ipbesThematicAssessmentReport2024].
- Ecosystem services are "the contributions that ecosystems (i.e. living systems) make to human well-being" [@haines-youngCommonInternationalClassification2018], which can take the form of "ecological characteristics, functions or processes" [@costanzaTwentyYearsEcosystem2017]
- Present/Disseminate in policy-making since the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment [@millenniumecosystemassessmentmeaEcosystemsHumanWellbeing2005]
- Used as a way to economically value all the direct and indirect contributions of ecosystems to human well-being, classified as provisioning (e.g. crops, forage, wood), regulating (e.g. pollination, climate regulation) or cultural (e.g. aesthetics, artistic inspiration) [@haines-youngCommonInternationalClassification2018].
- Within the ecosystem service framework, grazing systems are not only reduced to their capacity at sustaining livestock production, but also as a support of multiple regulating and cultural services [@kremenEcosystemServicesBiologically2012; @leprovostSupplyMultipleEcosystem2022].

**(3) The synthesis chapter (abstract, conclusion) should focus in on the advances to understanding that can be drawn from the integration of the four data chapters**

- New structure of the conclusion: 1) Reminder aim (15% space); 2) Findings (60%); Perspectives (25%)
- Abstract: try to get findings/perspectives to 75%/25%

**(4) The synthesis chapter lacks a section presenting the overarching hypotheses of the study**

- Overarching questions (instead of the initial paper list), with matching subsections in the Findings
- Q1: What is the influence of the regional environment on semi-natural grasslands and heathlands (**paper II**, **paper III**, **paper IV**)?
  - Q1-1: Can we confirm the hump-shaped productivity pattern along the coast-to-mountain gradient (**paper IV**)?
  - Q1-2: Can we detect the influence of geographic or climatic factors on the taxonomic and functional composition of semi-natural grasslands (**paper II**, **paper III**, **paper IV**)?
- Q2: What are the synergies and trade-offs between biodiversity and ecosystem services among semi-natural grasslands and heathlands (**paper II**, **paper III**, **paper IV**)?
- Q3: Which management factor influence diversity and community composition in semi-natural grasslands and heathlands (**paper I**, **paper II**, **paper III**, **paper IV**)?
  - Q3-1: Is there an effect of livestock type or grazing intensity on diversity and community composition in semi-natural grasslands (**paper II**, **paper III**)?
  - Q3-2: What is the effect of prescribed burning on taxonomic and functional diversity in semi-natural heathlands (**paper I**, **paper IV**)?

**(5) More details are needed in the description of some of the methods used for data collection, both in the synthesis chapter, in paper III and in paper IV**

- New sort of "Assessment approach" subsection before the Data collection subsection.
- Mostly writing: description of indicators and taxa for different papers

**(6) The structure and order of presentation could be reworked**

- Found issue (both me and Amy): general ecological knowledge on grazing, biodiversity and ecosystem services in the last introductory section, which should be focused on the NBR context
- Mostly moving around already existing paragraphs: new introductory section like "relationships between grazing management, biodiversity and ecosystem services" after section from Issue #2
- Resulting Introduction structure
  (1) Livestock's part in the global food security challenge
  (2) From productivist agriculture to multifunctional agroecological systems
  (3) Relationships between grazing management, biodiversity and ecosystem services
  (4) UNESCO's MAB
  (5) The NBR as case study
  (6) Accounting for the landform-climate gradient of the fjord region
  (7) Characteristics of the small-scale grazing systems of the NBR
