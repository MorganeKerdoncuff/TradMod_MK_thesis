## Grazing x biodiversity

## The Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis {.center}

:::{.notes}
- At moderate intensity, grazing pressure is expected to be strong enough to locally overcome the competition for light, but not so excessive as to homogenise the sward with grazing-tolerant species [@koernerChangeDominanceDetermines2018; @olffEffectsHerbivoresGrassland1998].
- This intermediate stage of highest spatial heterogeneity should result in a biodiversity optimum, by favouring the coexistence of multiple life strategies and ecological niches for plant and animal communities [@ceraboliniWhyAreMany2016; @steinEnvironmentalHeterogeneityUniversal2014].
:::

:::{.notes}
- In nutrient-poor habitats, the prevalence of stress-tolerance strategies usually limits plant growth rate and reproductive capacities [@diazGlobalSpectrumPlant2016; @pierceLeafEconomicsSpectrum2007], increasing the vulnerability of communities to ruderal and fast-growing species [@pakemanConsistencyPlantSpecies2004; @teuberLivestockGrazingIntermountain2013].
- The relationship between grazing and biodiversity thus depends on both the ecosystem capacity to tolerate disturbance [@piipponenGlobalTrendsGrassland2022] and the management adaptability to abiotic constraints [@plieningerTraditionalLanduseNature2006; @torokGrazingEuropeanOpen2016].

![The multiple drivers of cultural, aboveground regulating and provisioning ecosystem services in grasslands, from @leprovostSupplyMultipleEcosystem2022.](illustrations/presentation/leprovostAdapted.png){#fig-leprovost}

:::{.notes}
- Biodiversity consistently positively correlated with the delivery of regulating and cultural services [@soliveresBiodiversityMultipleTrophic2016; @yangSoilCarbonSequestration2019].
- Pollination service: plant taxonomic and functional richness supports greater availability, stability and plurality of nectar resource [@balfourTradeoffPollinatorwildflowerDiversity2025; @goulnikFloralTraitFunctional2020; @heglandRelationshipsDensityDiversity2006].
- Provisioning: diversity was shown to enhance biomass production and nutritional quality in semi-natural grasslands [@soliveresBiodiversityMultipleTrophic2016; @spehnEcosystemEffectsBiodiversity2005] but productivity-oriented management usually results into a loss of rare species [@brunProductivitybiodiversityRelationshipVaries2019; @schulzTradeoffsGrasslandPlant2024].
:::

## Research needs

- Need for policy-oriented research to investigate synergies and trade-offs under different farming models and across multiple ecosystems and sociocultural backgrounds [@egliWinnersLosersNational2018; @rockstromSustainableIntensificationAgriculture2017].
- Complex interactions
- Multiple parameters (environment/productivity)
- Knowledge gaps for low-intensity systems

- **Biosphere Reserves**: model areas for experimenting innovative pathways for sustainable development [@barracloughGlobalKnowledgeAction2023; @unescoNewRoadmapMan2017].

:::{.notes}
- In Western Norway, the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Area was designated to "be based on the best from the past and [...] pave the way for a future-oriented societal development that ensures the sustainable use of all types of resources for the benefit and pleasure of both the present inhabitants and future generations" [@kalandNordhordlandBiosphereReserve2018].

Source: @brekkeKulturhistoriskVegbokHordaland1993.](illustrations/NBR_IntroHistoryBox.png){#fig-succession}

## Post-WW2 rationalisation of livestock production

- Livestock moved to the infields to address market demands [@jonesLandtenureLandscapeChange1988].
- Consequences: enlargement and intensification of fertile fields and abandonment of remote and nutrient-poor areas.
- Smaller holdings (under 10 ha) most impacted: dropped from representing 90% of total Norwegian farms in 1949 to 53% in 1995 [@fjellstadPatternsChangeTwo1999].

## Current agroecological context

- (1) A constraining environment associated with the fjord landscape.
- (2) Semi-natural grasslands (infields) & heathlands (outfields).
- (3) Management in grasslands: rotational grazing, different livestock types
- (4) Management in heathlands: free-ranging livestock, prescribed burning

:::{.notes}
- Low-intensity grazing, with high diversity of land uses and farm structures.
- Semi-natural heathlands: free-ranging sheep or goats, year-round grazing on the coastline, summer farming in the mountains.
- Semi-natural grasslands: mixed dairy-beef systems, extensive sheep and goat farming, rotational grazing.

## Key points

- Fjord landscape: constraining environment
- Management: low-intensity grazing, with high diversity of land uses and farm structures.
- Expectations: coupled influences of the environment and management supporting ecological diversity and landscape multifunctionality.

:::{.notes}
At the scale of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, these different production systems are expected to complement each others in maintaining an ecologically diverse and multifunctional agroecological landscape [@kremenEcosystemServicesBiologically2012; @sollenbergerGrasslandManagementAffects2019].

## Study approach

- table indicators

:::{.notes}
- We relied on multiple taxonomic and functional indicators to obtain a comprehensive assessment of the impact of management on the diversity and community composition of semi-natural grasslands and heathlands.
- The analyses of functional groups and traits, which directly express species' responses to abiotic stress and disturbance [@mouillotFunctionalApproachReveals2013], are particularly pertinent in our study context.

## Postfire response

- Building from previous studies from @bargmannEffectsPrescribedBurning2015 and @bargmannSpeciesTraitSelection2016, who investigated postfire response of Carabidae in Western Norway.
- Investigation families with high specialisation level (e.g. Staphylinidae) and functional traits

# Methodological considerations

## Complex interactions in small-scale grazing systems

:::{.notes}
Our findings suggested that the independent influences of the environmental gradients and field management on the diversity and community composition of semi-natural grasslands were mediated by their mutual interactions at different spatial scales (**paper II**, **paper III**) (@fig-flowconcept).
The inconsistent outcomes from **paper III** may also suggest that relationships between the underlying regional gradient and plant and dung-associated beetle communities are characterised by more complex interactions [@dixonhamilCrossscaleContradictionsEcological2016; @petersCrossScaleInteractions2007] (see Discussion in **paper III**).
In **paper II** for example, we observed significant changes in plant functional group cover due to interactions between landscape zone and livestock type:
coastal sites grazed by cattle were characterised by the lowest forb cover, while fjord sites grazed by cattle showed the lowest grass/forb cover ratio.
On the other hand, we observed that dominant grass and forb assemblages were consistently correlated with a gradient of vegetation structure, which itself showed a weak correlation with the field management (**paper III**).

## Limitations of our study design

- Environmental heterogeneity
- Livestock-driven heterogeneity at the field scale
- Management-driven heterogeneity at the landscape scale
- Selection of biological indicators

## Optimisation methodological approach

:::{.notes}
(1) spatially-explicit analyses, in order to identify the processes driving variance in agroecological systems [@petersCrossScaleInteractions2007] and to disentangle the respective influences of management and underlying environmental gradients [e.g. @wittmanSocialEcologicalPerspective2017; @redlichDisentanglingEffectsClimate2022];
(2) farm- or landscape-scale approaches, to address environmental and management-driven variance not as a bias but as an inherent determinant of agroecological systems [@cloughFieldSizesFuture2020; @deffontainesAgriculturalSystemsLandscape1995; @sinclairOptionsContextApproach2019] (see Discussion in **paper III**);
(3) high resolution indicators, with priority given to taxa contributing to key ecosystem functions such as soil fauna [@bardgettBelowgroundBiodiversityEcosystem2014; @degraaffEffectsAgriculturalIntensification2019.
(4) transdisciplinary approaches, to ensure the pertinence, applicability and accessibility of agroecological research by directly involving the farmers as knowledge-holders, decision-makers and managers [@bennettLinkingBiodiversityEcosystem2015; @jagerPathwaysImplementationEvidence2020; @rockstromSustainableIntensificationAgriculture2017].

## Perspectives for the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve

- pamphlet

:::{.notes}
We recommend to deepen collaboration with local farmers to investigate more thoroughly the plant and animal communities of semi-natural grasslands and heathlands in relation to management.
Further research could aim for:
replicating @losvikHayMeadowCommunities1993' study, to compare the evolution of plant communities of semi-natural grasslands over time and determine whether they have been affected by the changes in management (see Discussion in **paper IV**);
leading farm-scale assessments of plant and animal communities, to gain a better understanding of how rotational management and farmers' decision-making affect biodiversity and ecosystem service delivery in the agroecological landscapes of the fjord region (see Discussion in **paper II** and **paper III**);
addressing knowledge gaps regarding arthropods' response to management and environmental factors, which are considerable in Norway [@kalasEnvironmentalConditionsImpacts2010; @totlandStateKnowledgeInsect2013] (see Discussion in **paper I** and **paper IV**);
integrating biodiversity assessments in the small-scale grazing systems of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve within the ecosystem service framework, in order to facilitate local and regional policy-making [@cusensParticipatoryMappingReveals2022; @cusensIntegrationMattersCombining2023].
