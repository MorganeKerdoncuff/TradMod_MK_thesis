# General context

## Livestock's part in the global food security challenge

- Food demand is expected to increase between **30%** and **62%** by 2050 [@vandijkMetaanalysisProjectedGlobal2021].
- Failure of the Green Revolution to address global food security [@cassidyRedefiningAgriculturalYields2013; @garibaldiFarmingApproachesGreater2017].
- Decline and degradation of global grassland areas [@bardgettCombattingGlobalGrassland2021]
- Large environmental externalities [@cunninghamCloseYieldgapSaving2013; @hongGlobalRegionalDrivers2021].

## Beyond the productivist perspective

- New dominant paradigm: synergy between food security, the integrity of ecosystems and human well-being [@fischerReframingFoodBiodiversity2017; @ipbesThematicAssessmentReport2024].
- **Ecosystem services**: ecological characteristics, functions or processes used for the economic valuation of ecosystem contributions to human well-being [@costanzaTwentyYearsEcosystem2017; @haines-youngCommonInternationalClassification2018].
- **Multifunctionality**: capacity of agricultural systems to ensure the delivery of multiple ecosystem services [@oecdMultifunctionalityAnalyticalFramework2001].

<!-- - Main principles: diversified and locally-adapted farming practices for the provision of multiple benefits [@rasmussenJointEnvironmentalSocial2024]. -->
<!-- - Examples: agroecology, diversified farming, sustainable intensification. -->

## Research needs

- Need for policy-oriented research to investigate synergies and trade-offs under different farming models and across multiple ecosystems and sociocultural backgrounds [@egliWinnersLosersNational2018; @rockstromSustainableIntensificationAgriculture2017].


# Relationships between grazing, biodiversity and ecosystem services

## General assumptions

- Grazing x biodiversity: Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis

![Plant diversity of grassland communities in relation to grazing intensity along gradients of moisture and grazing evolutionary history, from @milchunasGeneralizedModelEffects1988](illustrations/presentation/milchunasGeneralizedModelEffects1988.png){#fig-milchunas}

## General assumptions

- Biodiversity x ecosystem services: synergy

Expected synergies: underlying ecosystem processes affected by different sets of species [@hectorBiodiversityEcosystemMultifunctionality2007; @soliveresBiodiversityMultipleTrophic2016].
:::

## The Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis {.center}

:::{.notes}
- At moderate intensity, grazing pressure is expected to be strong enough to locally overcome the competition for light, but not so excessive as to homogenise the sward with grazing-tolerant species [@koernerChangeDominanceDetermines2018; @olffEffectsHerbivoresGrassland1998].
- This intermediate stage of highest spatial heterogeneity should result in a biodiversity optimum, by favouring the coexistence of multiple life strategies and ecological niches for plant and animal communities [@ceraboliniWhyAreMany2016; @steinEnvironmentalHeterogeneityUniversal2014].
:::

:::{.notes}
- In nutrient-poor habitats, the prevalence of stress-tolerance strategies usually limits plant growth rate and reproductive capacities [@diazGlobalSpectrumPlant2016; @pierceLeafEconomicsSpectrum2007], increasing the vulnerability of communities to ruderal and fast-growing species [@pakemanConsistencyPlantSpecies2004; @teuberLivestockGrazingIntermountain2013].
- The relationship between grazing and biodiversity thus depends on both the ecosystem capacity to tolerate disturbance [@piipponenGlobalTrendsGrassland2022] and the management adaptability to abiotic constraints [@plieningerTraditionalLanduseNature2006; @torokGrazingEuropeanOpen2016].

## Biodiversity and ecosystem service synergies and trade-offs

![The multiple drivers of cultural, aboveground regulating and provisioning ecosystem services in grasslands, from @leprovostSupplyMultipleEcosystem2022.](illustrations/presentation/leprovostAdapted.png){#fig-leprovost}

:::{.notes}
- Biodiversity consistently positively correlated with the delivery of regulating and cultural services [@soliveresBiodiversityMultipleTrophic2016; @yangSoilCarbonSequestration2019].
- Pollination service: plant taxonomic and functional richness supports greater availability, stability and plurality of nectar resource [@balfourTradeoffPollinatorwildflowerDiversity2025; @goulnikFloralTraitFunctional2020; @heglandRelationshipsDensityDiversity2006].
- Provisioning: diversity was shown to enhance biomass production and nutritional quality in semi-natural grasslands [@soliveresBiodiversityMultipleTrophic2016; @spehnEcosystemEffectsBiodiversity2005] but productivity-oriented management usually results into a loss of rare species [@brunProductivitybiodiversityRelationshipVaries2019; @schulzTradeoffsGrasslandPlant2024].

## Key points

- Complex interactions
- Multiple parameters (environment/productivity)
- Knowledge gaps for low-intensity systems

## Effect prescribed burning

- Prescribed burning cycle
- Local scale: graph diversity x recovery
- regional scale: prescribed burning was found to increase divergence between heathland communities when adapted to local environmental conditions [@velleDoesPrescribedBurning2014; @velleSuccessionPrescribedBurning2014].

# The small-scale grazing systems of Western Norway as a case study

## The Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve

- UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB): to "improve human livelihoods, and the equitable sharing of benefits, and to safeguard natural and managed ecosystems, promoting innovative approaches to economic development that are socially and culturally appropriate and environmentally sustainable" [@unescoManBiosphereProgramme2025].
- **Biosphere Reserves**: model areas for experimenting innovative pathways for sustainable development [@barracloughGlobalKnowledgeAction2023; @unescoNewRoadmapMan2017].
<!-- - World Network of Biosphere Reserves: 784 sites across 142 countries for a total population of 300 million people [@unescoManBiosphereProgramme2025]. -->

:::{.notes}
- In Western Norway, the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Area was designated to "be based on the best from the past and [...] pave the way for a future-oriented societal development that ensures the sustainable use of all types of resources for the benefit and pleasure of both the present inhabitants and future generations" [@kalandNordhordlandBiosphereReserve2018].

## The traditional infield-outfield systems

<!-- - Livestock grazing in the outfields, crops in the infields. -->

## Post-WW2 rationalisation of livestock production

- Livestock moved to the infields to address market demands [@jonesLandtenureLandscapeChange1988].
- Consequences: enlargement and intensification of fertile fields and abandonment of remote and nutrient-poor areas.
- Smaller holdings (under 10 ha) most impacted: dropped from representing 90% of total Norwegian farms in 1949 to 53% in 1995 [@fjellstadPatternsChangeTwo1999].


## Current management practices

:::{.notes}
- Low-intensity grazing, with high diversity of land uses and farm structures.
- Semi-natural heathlands: free-ranging sheep or goats, year-round grazing on the coastline, summer farming in the mountains.
- Semi-natural grasslands: mixed dairy-beef systems, extensive sheep and goat farming, rotational grazing.

## Key points

- Fjord landscape: constraining environment
- Management: low-intensity grazing, with high diversity of land uses and farm structures.
- Expectations: coupled influences of the environment and management supporting ecological diversity and landscape multifunctionality.

:::{.notes}
At the scale of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, these different production systems are expected to complement each others in maintaining an ecologically diverse and multifunctional agroecological landscape [@kremenEcosystemServicesBiologically2012; @sollenbergerGrasslandManagementAffects2019].

# PhD thesis

## Aim of the thesis

- This PhD thesis aims to explore how grazing-dependent habitats support biodiversity and ecosystem service delivery in the agroecological landscape of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.
- Our work was based on observational studies of 42 semi-natural grasslands and heathlands, distributed across a west-east gradient in the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.

Quotation to emphasize the interest of farm-level ecological studies - "*We suggest that agricultural landscapes are better understood and modelled when farm structure and functioning is the starting point of the research*" from @deffontainesAgriculturalSystemsLandscape1995
