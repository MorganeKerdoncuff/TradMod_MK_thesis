## Pictures

- Western Norway
- South America terracces
- Africa sylviculture
- Asia rice production
- corons/carriere de sable ?

## What is the common point between these pictures?

- All theses landscapes can be defined as cultural landscapes
- when defining a landscape, usually we talk about composition, structure, open vs closed, wild vs anthropogenic
- for cultural, rather the use: food, resources for housing

## Beyond the nature vs culture paradigm

- Pristine nature: vision dominant amongst conservationists in the XIX^th^ and XX^th^ centuries [@phillipsNatureCulturalLandscapes1998].
- Nature shaped by humans for millenia: fire, livestock grazing, exploitation of forest resources [@ellisPeopleHaveShaped2021].
<!-- - two-ways interactions between humans and the environment, inherently sustainable (have to be maintained over long time periods) -->
<!-- - "[cultural landscapes] are the result of human intervention in the natural landscape and present a record of human activity and human values" [@taylorAustralianPerspectivesThemes1993]. -->
<!-- - "cultural landscapes reflect the interactions between people and their natural environment over space and time" [@plachterCulturalLandscapesReconnecting1995]. -->
- Cultural landscapes represent the "**combined works of nature and of man**" and are "illustrative of the evolution of human society and settlement over time, under the influence of the **physical constraints and/or opportunities presented by their natural environment** and of successive **social, economic and cultural forces**" (https://whc.unesco.org).

## International recognition

- **IUCN resolution (1988)**: recognises that landscapes materially altered by humans can be of great value for local biodiversity and socio-economic development and "of particular importance to many developing countries".
- **UNESCO World Heritage Convention (1992)**: first international legal instrument to recognise and protect cultural landscapes.
- **IUCN definition of protected landscape (1994)**: "an area of land [...], where the interaction of people and nature over time has produced an area of distinct character with significant aesthetic, ecological and/or cultural value, and often with high biological diversity."

:::{.notes}
- this is what is under the trees: stratified shell middens, resulting from the accumulation of fire residuals and organic deposition
:::

## Environmental context and Human occupation history

- Early to mid-Holocene period: region dominated by seasonally flooded savannahs [@lombardoHoloceneLandCover2019].
- 10,350 BP: earliest signs of *Manihot* (wild ancestor of manioc) cultivation in forest islands [@lombardoEarlyHoloceneCrop2020].
- 4,000 BP: agricultural transformation facilitated by the changes in hydrological conditions (Rio Grande shift) [@lombardoMidLateHoloceneFluvial2012].
- 6,000 years of human utilisation of shell middens for foraging and cultivation.

## Implications for biodiversity

- **Niche construction** [@smithNicheConstructionBehavioral2007; @smithGeneralPatternsNiche2011]: "organism-driven environmental modification" (environmental engineering).
- Refuges for plants and animals during seasonal floods.
- Fertility hotspots amidst the generally poor savannah soil.
- Contribute to landscape heterogeneity and increase connectivity between forested areas.
- Feeding and roosting sites for endemic and critically-endangered blue-throated macaw (*Ara glaucogularis*).

# Human use of nature for food production: Agroecological systems

## Nature's Contribution to People

- **Ecosystem service framework**
- Food production: provisioning service
- Domestication: millenia ago
- Agriculture represents such and such worldwide
- Many forms of agriculture, adapted to local context [@gandiniAnalysisCulturalValue2003]

## Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS)

- "GIAHS are the result of the **gradual co-evolution of local communities and their environments**. In response to local challenges, communities have developed **sustainable farming systems** by conserving and using traditional knowledge, biodiversity and landscapes, while supporting their livelihoods and food security" (https://www.fao.org).
- Programme launched by the FAO at the World Summit for Sustainable Development in 2002, with the objective to "identify and safeguard GIAHS and their associated landscapes, agricultural biodiversity and knowledge systems".

## Case studies

:::{.notes}
- three case studies, with different levels of human intervention, from which we will explore the links between cultural landscape and biodiversity.

**Rice-fish farming systems in Longxian village, China**

## Environmental context and Human occupation history

- 6000-8000 BP: development irrigated rice cultivation [@luoBiodiversityConservationRice2014].
- 2000 BP (Han Dynasty): first archaeological evidence of rice-fish co-culture.

## Underlying mechanisms and associated benefits

- Rice-fish mutualistic relationships [@xieEcologicalMechanismsUnderlying2011]:
  - fish reduces insect pests, diseases and weeds, and fertilises the water.
  - rice provides shade, reduces ammonia concentration in water and hosts potential preys for the fish.
- Provides essential complex of proteins for local communities.

## Implications for biodiversity

- Conservation of local species of rice and fish [@liuAgriculturalLandscapesBiodiversity2013].
- Domesticated species as **ecosystem architects**
- Diversification trophic network: succession interdependent arthropod communities according to rice growth phases (pest, natural enemy, neutral) [@luoBiodiversityConservationRice2014].
- Reduced use of chemicals (pesticides, fertilisation): enhances water quality and supports plankton and predatory arthropod diversity [@liBiodiversitySustainabilityIntegrated2021; @luoBiodiversityConservationRice2014].

## Implications for biodiversity

- Ridge-ditch patterns: enhance structural heterogeneity and support spider and wasp diversity [@liuAgriculturalLandscapesBiodiversity2013].
- Landscape complexity in rice cultivation systems: enhances total diversity and more specifically amphibians, spiders & beetles [@cambero-conejeroEffectsLandscapeComplexity2026].

<!-- ## Biodiversity at the landscape level -->

<!-- - landscape complexity enhances total diversity and more specifically amphibians, spiders & beetles [@cambero-conejeroEffectsLandscapeComplexity2026]. -->
<!-- - Ridge-ditch patterns enhance structural heterogeneity and support spider and wasp diversity [@liuAgriculturalLandscapesBiodiversity2013]. -->
<!-- - impact across scale, from the water ditch to the landscape [@burgiExploringLinksCulture2015]. -->

# Shaping structural heterogeneity {background-image="illustrations/trial.lecture/chagga.home6.png" background-size="cover"}

**Traditional agroforestry in Chagga Homegardens on Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania**

## Environmental context and Human occupation history

- 2000 BP: permanent settlers on the slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro [@hempChaggaHomegardensKilimanjaro2008].
- XII^th^ century (estimation): first home gardens irrigated by water canals.

## Underlying mechanisms and associated benefits

- Multi-storied system: coffee and banana crops involving the integration of livestock and multi-purpose indigenous trees and shrubs [@hempBananaForestsKilimanjaro2006].
- Multiple benefits [@fernandesChaggaHomeGardens1985]: 
  - market-oriented coffee and banana production;
  - provision of fruits, livestock forage, medicinal plants, timber and firewood.

## Implications for biodiversity

- **Structural heterogeneity**: diversification ecological niches.
- Plants [@hempChaggaHomegardensKilimanjaro2008]:
  - indigenous species account for over 70% of total species found in home gardens.
  - diversity life forms: trees, shrubs, herbs, lianas (52 species), epiphytes.

# Adaptative spatio-temporal dynamics {background-image="illustrations/trial.lecture/puna.high1.webp" background-size="cover"}

**Traditional Andean pastoralism systems in Dry Puna highlands (3,000-5,000 masl), Argentina**

## Human occupation history

- 10,000 BP: first evidence of human occupation in Andean Puna ecosystems, following a shift towards more humid climate [@baiedEvolutionHighAndean1993].
- 7,000 BP: first signs of ungulate domestication leading to the appearance of two domestic species, the llama (*Lama glama*) and the alpaca (*Vicugna pacos*) [@yacobaccioModelLlamaLama2016].
- 2,7000 BP: development of llama herding practices in the Dry Puna.
- 1,000 BP: herding as predominant subsistence strategy, with the development of long-distance exchange networks using large size llamas as pack animals [@samecLateHoloceneCamelid2025].
- Nowadays: supports 1 million pastoralists in the region [@arzamendiaPunaPastoralistSystem2021].

## Underlying mechanisms and associated benefits

- Adaptation to arid ecosystem: low and highly variable rainfall, low average temperatures and large thermal amplitude [@navarroRewildingLargeHerbivore2020].
- Mobility of humans and livestock

- Livestock transhumance: adaptation to generally arid ecosystem [@arzamendiaPunaPastoralistSystem2021].
  - permanent and semi-permanent residence sites;
  - seasonal management of fertile areas at different elevations;
  - complementary use of sheep, llamas and goats.
  
@browmanPastoralismDevelopmentHigh1984
- "Resilience strategy" flexible & co-operative
- seasonal transhumance to take advantage of of locally occuring conditions
- herd dispersion over wide areas to take advantage of local patch types
- multi-species diversification
  
- Stability of peatland productivity [@navarroRewildingLargeHerbivore2020]: long-term human use, including low-intensity grazing, livestock rotation, transhumance between peatlands, irrigation and water management.
- Long fallow periods: improve soil fertility

- Cultural adaptation: Complementary use of altitudinal agroclimatic belts, crop & livestock rotation [@rolandoKeyEcosystemServices2017]

- Benefits [@arzamendiaPunaPastoralistSystem2021]:
- Fiber production
- Medicinal plants
- Cultural rites
- Manure for crops

<!-- - Seasonal movements (Peru): -->
<!-- - rainy season December-March: January to the hills, with horizontal & vertical movements to access two types of rangelands: dry grasslands & *bofedales* (peatlands) -->
<!-- - dry season April-November: April to main residence in pampa -->

## Implications for biodiversity

- Camel: biocultural heritage
- **Landscape mosaic** [@rojoSpatialTemporalVariation2019]:
  - Festuca chrysophylla grasslands (dry season grazing)
  - peatlands
  - shrubland communities: Parastrephia spp (tolares), and low-productivity Baccharis boliviensis, Fabiana densa, and Tetraglochin cristatum
  - short grasslands
  
- Impact factors on communities: disturbance intensity, slope aspect, elevation % outcropping rocks, edaphic parameters [@catorciHowEnvironmentGrazing2014]
- First partition with High grazing intensity: promotes avoidance strategies such as thorny dwarf shrubs, annual species or small/prostrate plants
- Second partition is % outcropping rocks: two communities subjected to intermediate levels of disturbance
- Fourth community: Festuca grassland with low grazing intensity & higher richness & internal variability

- @velardez-fresiaLongtermInteractionsAvifauna2024
- long-term interactions between local communities and birds: seasonal management & activities lead to variations in the distribution of animal & plant resources
- stability bird population: proximity of wild birds to domestic spaces: human modifications (dams, cultivation, introduced vegetation) can provide feeding, roosting, breeding sites and refuges.

- this spatiotemporal dynamics only sustainable practice to maintain agriculture in these arid regions.
- Complementarity systems: livestock x crops

@browmanPastoralismDevelopmentHigh1984
- Intensification risks: erosion, compaction & increase undesirable species
- Native alpacas & llamas with higher metabolization efficiency compared with sheep -> gain weight faster while less negative impact

@navarroHerbivoreRewildingDoes2023
- Rewilding vs livestock in peatland biodiversity
- diversity best explained by elevation (decreases vegetation & aquatic macroinvertebrates) & peatland aera (increases plant, birds, aquatic macroinvertebrates)
- diversity plant & macroinv negatively correlated with wilderness index
- no association bird diversity x wilderness
- water: both extraction for irrigation & redistribution to expand peatland area -> latter + regulation livestock load may increase peatland stability
- overall, well adapted to herbivores
- Potential explanations: (1) diversity of microhabitats generated by a more diverse herbivore's community associated with livestock (e.g., different trampling, browsing, and movement patterns, effects on water quality through feces), (2) management of hydrological regimes and stocking rates to provide stability, (3) herbivory dynamics that promote the dominance of certain plants
