## Beyond the nature vs culture paradigm

- Pristine nature: vision dominant amongst conservationists in the XIX^th^ and XX^th^ centuries [@phillipsNatureCulturalLandscapes1998].
- Nature shaped by humans for millenia: fire, livestock grazing, exploitation of forest resources [@ellisPeopleHaveShaped2021].
- **Social-ecological systems**: result from the co-evolving interactions between human and nature [@herrero-jaureguiWhatWeTalk2018].
- "**Cultural landscapes** are illustrative of the evolution of human society and settlement over time, under the influence of the **physical constraints and/or opportunities presented by their natural environment** and of successive **social, economic and cultural forces**" (https://whc.unesco.org).

:::{.notes}
- two-ways interactions between humans and the environment, inherently sustainable (have to be maintained over long time periods)
- "[cultural landscapes] are the result of human intervention in the natural landscape and present a record of human activity and human values" [@taylorAustralianPerspectivesThemes1993].
- "cultural landscapes reflect the interactions between people and their natural environment over space and time" [@plachterCulturalLandscapesReconnecting1995].
:::
  
## International recognition

- **IUCN resolution (1988)**: recognises that landscapes materially altered by humans can be of great value for local biodiversity and socio-economic development and "of particular importance to many developing countries".
- **UNESCO World Heritage Convention (1992)**: first international legal instrument to recognise and protect cultural landscapes.
- **IUCN definition of protected landscape (1994)**: "an area of land [...], where the interaction of people and nature over time has produced an area of distinct character with significant aesthetic, ecological and/or cultural value, and often with high biological diversity".

:::{.notes}
- this is what is under the trees: stratified shell middens, resulting from the accumulation of fire residuals and organic deposition
:::

## Human occupation history

- Early to mid-Holocene period: region dominated by seasonally flooded savannahs [@lombardoHoloceneLandCover2019].
- 10,350 BP: earliest signs of *Manihot* (wild ancestor of manioc) cultivation in forest islands [@lombardoEarlyHoloceneCrop2020].
- 4,000 BP: agricultural transformation facilitated by the changes in hydrological conditions (Rio Grande shift) [@lombardoMidLateHoloceneFluvial2012].
- 6,000 years of human utilisation of shell middens for foraging and cultivation.

## Assessing the benefits from the utilisation of nature

- **Ecosystem services (ES)**: ecological characteristics, functions or processes used for the economic valuation of all direct and indirect contributions of ecosystems to human well-being [@costanzaTwentyYearsEcosystem2017; @haines-youngCommonInternationalClassification2018].
- Three broad categories:
  - provisioning: direct supply of energy or material resources (e.g. crops, forage, wood);
  - regulating: biotic-abiotic processes supporting human development and prosperity (e.g. pollination, climate regulation);
  - cultural: non-material benefits to human mental and physical well-being (e.g. aesthetics, artistic inspiration).

## Implications for biodiversity

- **Niche construction**: "organism-driven environmental modification" (environmental engineering) [@smithNicheConstructionBehavioral2007; @smithGeneralPatternsNiche2011].
- Refuges for plants and animals during seasonal floods.
- Fertility hotspots amidst the generally poor savannah soil.
- Contribute to landscape heterogeneity and increase connectivity between forested areas.
- Feeding and roosting sites for endemic and critically-endangered blue-throated macaw (*Ara glaucogularis*).

# Domesticating nature for food production {background-image="illustrations/trial.lecture/slidebg8.png" background-size="cover"}

**Case studies of three agroecological systems**

## Large and long-lasting human impact

- ~400,000 BP: evidence of large-scale use of fire by humans [@macdonaldMiddlePleistoceneFire2021].
- 11,700 BP: first signs of plant domestication [@careyUnearthingOriginsAgriculture2023].
- ~10,000 BP: first signs of animal domestication into livestock [@machughTamingAncientDNA2017].
- First land cover globally: 4,800 million hectares globally, among which 1,600 million ha of cropland and 3,200 million ha of pastures (FAOSTAT 2023).
- High diversity of farming systems, with about 35% of the world's food produced by smallholders (<2 ha) (FAO 2021).

## Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS)

- "GIAHS are the result of the **gradual co-evolution of local communities and their environments**. In response to local challenges, communities have developed **sustainable farming systems** by conserving and using traditional knowledge, biodiversity and landscapes, while supporting their livelihoods and food security" (https://www.fao.org).
- Programme launched by the FAO at the World Summit for Sustainable Development in 2002.
- Objective: to "identify and safeguard GIAHS and their associated landscapes, agricultural biodiversity and knowledge systems".

## Case studies {background-image="illustrations/trial.lecture/slidebg9.png" background-size="contain"}

:::{.notes}
- three case studies, with different levels of human intervention, from which we will explore the links between cultural landscape and biodiversity.

:::

## Human occupation history {footer=false}

- 6000-8000 BP: development irrigated rice cultivation [@luoBiodiversityConservationRice2014].
- 2000 BP (Han Dynasty): first archaeological evidence of rice-fish co-culture [@luReviewRiceFish2006].
- XX^^th century: large development of rice-fish farming systems, from 667.000 ha in 1959 to 1,532,000 ha in 2000.
- Since 2002: steady decline of 30,000 ha annually.
- 2005: listed as GIAHS (https://www.fao.org).

## Underlying mechanisms and associated benefits

- Rice-fish mutualistic relationships [@luReviewRiceFish2006; @xieEcologicalMechanismsUnderlying2011]:
  - fish reduces insect pests, diseases and weeds, and fertilises the water.
  - rice provides shade, reduces ammonia concentration in water and hosts potential preys for the fish.
- Possible coupling with duck, *Azolla*, turtle, crayfish [@geEcosystemSustainabilityRice2023; @luoBiodiversityConservationRice2014].
- Provides essential complex of proteins for local communities.

## Implications for biodiversity

### Pond scale

- Conservation of local species of rice and fish (e.g. Oujiang red carp) [@liuAgriculturalLandscapesBiodiversity2013].
- Diversification trophic network: succession interdependent arthropod communities according to rice growth phases (pest, natural enemy, neutral) [@luoBiodiversityConservationRice2014].
- Reduced use of chemicals (pesticides, fertilisation): enhances water quality and supports plankton and predatory arthropod diversity [@liBiodiversitySustainabilityIntegrated2021; @luoBiodiversityConservationRice2014].

## Implications for biodiversity

### Landscape scale

- Ridge-ditch patterns: enhance structural heterogeneity and support spider and wasp diversity [@liuAgriculturalLandscapesBiodiversity2013].
- Landscape complexity in rice cultivation systems: enhances total diversity and more specifically amphibians, spiders and beetles [@cambero-conejeroEffectsLandscapeComplexity2026].

<!-- ## Biodiversity at the landscape level -->

<!-- - landscape complexity enhances total diversity and more specifically amphibians, spiders & beetles [@cambero-conejeroEffectsLandscapeComplexity2026]. -->
<!-- - Ridge-ditch patterns enhance structural heterogeneity and support spider and wasp diversity [@liuAgriculturalLandscapesBiodiversity2013]. -->
<!-- - impact across scale, from the water ditch to the landscape [@burgiExploringLinksCulture2015]. -->

:::

## Human occupation history {footer=false}

- 2000 BP: permanent settlers on the slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro [@hempChaggaHomegardensKilimanjaro2008].
- XII^th^ century: first home gardens (*Kihamba*) irrigated by water canals.
- XX^th^ century: dramatic population increase, from about 100,000 people in 1913 to 1,053,204 people in 2002.
- XXI^th^: Chagga homegardens cover about 1 000 km^2^ in the southern and southeastern slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro.
- 2011: listed as GIAHS (https://www.fao.org).

## Underlying mechanisms and associated benefits

- Multi-storied system: coffee and banana crops involving the integration of livestock and multi-purpose indigenous trees and shrubs [@hempBananaForestsKilimanjaro2006].
- Multiple benefits [@fernandesChaggaHomeGardens1985]: 
  - market-oriented coffee and banana production;
  - **crop-livestock system**: forage for livestock, crop fertilisation with manure;
  - provision of fruits, pollinator resources, medicinal plants, timber and firewood.

## Implications for biodiversity

### Flora

- Diversity in shade, temperature and humidity conditions which facilitate different plant communities.
- Plants [@hempChaggaHomegardensKilimanjaro2008]:
  - indigenous species account for over 70% of total species found in home gardens;
  - diversity life forms: trees, shrubs, herbs, lianas (52 species), epiphytes.

### Fauna

- **Structural heterogeneity**: diversification ecological niches across a vertical gradient [@steinEnvironmentalHeterogeneityUniversal2014].
- Saltatoria (grasshoppers and bush crickets) [@hempChaggaHomeGardens2005]:
  - 52 species found in home gardens over 192 recorded for the whole Mt. Kilimanjaro;
  - 70% associated with forest communities, 30% associated with open areas;
  - 32% endemic species.

# Adaptative spatio-temporal dynamics {background-image="illustrations/trial.lecture/slidebg6.png" background-size="cover"}

**Traditional Andean pastoralism systems in Dry Puna highlands (3,000-5,000 masl), Argentina**

::: footer
©Greta Semplici
:::

## Human occupation history

- 10,000 BP: first evidence of human occupation in Andean Puna ecosystems, following a shift towards more humid climate [@baiedEvolutionHighAndean1993].
- 7,000 BP: first signs of ungulate domestication leading to the appearance of two domestic species, the llama (*Lama glama*) and the alpaca (*Vicugna pacos*) [@yacobaccioModelLlamaLama2016].
- 2,700 BP: development of llama herding practices in the Dry Puna.
- 1,000 BP: herding as predominant subsistence strategy, with the development of long-distance exchange networks using large size llamas as pack animals [@samecLateHoloceneCamelid2025].
- Nowadays: supports 1 million pastoralists in the region [@arzamendiaPunaPastoralistSystem2021].

## Underlying mechanisms and associated benefits

- Adaptation to arid ecosystem [@arzamendiaPunaPastoralistSystem2021; @browmanPastoralismDevelopmentHigh1984]:
  - **transhumance**: vertical livestock mobility to take advantage of seasonal productivity peaks (e.g. high elevations during rainy season);
  - **free-ranging**: horizontal livestock mobility to take advantage of high-productivity habitats (e.g. peatlands - *vegas*);
  - **native breeds**: alpacas & llamas with higher metabolization efficiency compared with sheep.

## Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK)

Sociocultural legacy of the cumulative body of knowledge, practices and beliefs of human societies, which evolves by adaptive processes and is passed down through generations [@berkesRediscoveryTraditionalEcological2000].

![Herder in Puna highlands ©Greta Semplici.](illustrations/trial.lecture/puna.high1.webp){#fig-puna.high1}

## Implications for biodiversity

- Llama and alpaca: biocultural heritage, lower impact on vegetation [@browmanPastoralismDevelopmentHigh1984].
- Spatiotemporal dynamics of management shape a **landscape mosaic**: *Festuca* grasslands, shrubland communities, peatlands [@catorciHowEnvironmentGrazing2014; @rojoSpatialTemporalVariation2019].
- Long-term interactions between herders and birds: human management and modifications (huts, cultivation) provide feeding and breeding sites [@velardez-fresiaLongtermInteractionsAvifauna2024].
- Rewilding vs livestock: higher biodiversity, productivity and stability of peatlands in managed areas [@navarroRewildingLargeHerbivore2020; @navarroHerbivoreRewildingDoes2023].

## Other example

![High-altitude pastoralism systems in the Trans-Himalaya, from @singhPastoralismSouthAsia2023](illustrations/trial.lecture/hap1.webp){#fig-hap1}

## Key insights from the case studies

- Long history of human-nature interactions, producing a strong sense of belonging from local communities.
- **Ecosystem services synergies**: crop and forage production as primary benefits, but multiple other services delivered (e.g. medicinal plants, water quality, pollination).
- Different scales and intensities of anthropogenic alteration of ecosystems (niche creation).
- Multi-purpose agriculture: strong spatial heterogeneity supporting biodiversity at landscape-scale.
- Adaptation of management practices to local conditions based on Traditional Ecological Knowledge.

**Slag heaps and quarries in Nord-Pas-de-Calais mining basin, France**

::: footer

:::

## Human history {footer=false}

- Early-XVIII^th^ century: first phase of the French Industrial Revolution.
- Mid-XVIII^th^ century: first slag heap (*terrils*) to store coal mining residuals.
- Two slag heap types according to carrying technologies: conical or with plateau.
- 1990: closing down of the last coal mine.
- Nowadays: about 200 sites in Nord-Pas-de-Calais mining basin, listed on the UNESCO World Heritage Convention.
- Strong memorial and cultural values associated with the industrial history of the region.

## Implication for biodiversity

### Active restoration in reclaimed sites

- Extreme disturbances over large areas require similarly intensive restoration efforts.
- Rehabilitation contaminated substrates (e.g. artificial soil mixtures, phytoremediation) to facilitate the recolonisation of the vegetation cover [@wieckol-rykMinimisingCoalMinings2023].
- Ecological engineering to improve the quality of spontaneous ponds and wetlands.

## Implication for biodiversity

### Spontaneous recolonisation

- No human intervention, only protection of the area.
- Biodiversity of spontaneous succession can overcome reclamation: e.g. bird diversity [@salekSpontaneousSuccessionOpencast2012].
- High geodiversity resulting from the combination of excavation and accumulation processes [@betardPatchScaleRelationshipsGeodiversity2013]: landscape mosaic including habitats of high ecological interest (e.g. European dry heath, communities of siliceous rocky slopes).
- Ecological niches for wild bees [@lowickiNewModelPollination2021; @seitzConservingBeesDestroyed2019], grasshoppers, birds and bats [@betardPatchScaleRelationshipsGeodiversity2013].

# Conclusion {background-image="illustrations/trial.lecture/titlebg2.png" background-size="cover"}

## Gradient of human intervention? {background-image="illustrations/trial.lecture/slidebg1.png" background-size="cover" footer=false}

:::{.notes}
- back to the first slide
- question not so pertinent anymore: how to characterise the "level" of human impact? Temporal scale (long-term)? Spatial scale (large areas)? Immediate intensity?
- low-intensity examples: forest islands, puna highlands durably shaped the landscape
:::

## Take-home

- Nature vs human paradigm long outdated: long-term anthropogenic influence on most terrestrial systems.
- Synergy between material benefits, cultural values and biodiversity:
  - relies on human-nature mutualistic processes;
  - usually results from diversified and locally-adapted practices;
  - requires a deep understanding of ecological interactions within the social-ecological systems.
- Perspectives: cultural landscapes as model areas for addressing global social and ecological crises.
