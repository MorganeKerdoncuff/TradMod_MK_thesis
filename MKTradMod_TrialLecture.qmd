## Pictures

- Western Norway
- South America terracces
- Africa sylviculture
- Asia rice production
- corons/carriere de sable ?

## What is the common point between these pictures?

- All theses landscapes can be defined as cultural landscapes
- when defining a landscape, usually we talk about composition, structure, open vs closed, wild vs anthropogenic
- for cultural, rather the use: food, resources for housing

## Generalities

@phillipsNatureCulturalLandscapes1998
- beyond the human vs pristine nature vision, dominant amongst conservationists in the XIX^th^ and XX^th^ centuries
- nature shaped by humans: fire, exploitation of forest resources (Amazonia)
- two-ways interactions between humans and the environment, inherently sustainable (have to be maintained over long time periods)
- "[cultural landscapes] are the result of human intervention in the natural landscape and present a record of human activity and human values." Taylor 1993
- "cultural landscapes reflect the interactions between people and their natural environment over space and time" Plachter & Rossler 1995

## International action/recognition

@phillipsNatureCulturalLandscapes1998
- Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (1972)
- "Cultural landscapes often reflect specific techniques of sustainable land use, considering the characteristics and limits of the natural environment they are established in, and a specific spiritual relationship to nature.
Protection of cultural landscapes can contribute to modern techniques of sustainable land use and can maintain or enhance natural values in the landscape.
The continued existence of traditional forms of land use supports biological diversity in many regions of the world.
The protection of traditional cultural landscapes is therefore helpful in maintaining biological diversity." UNESCO 1996
- Comments (disagreement with UNESCO definition): "specific spiritual relationship to nature" -> no? big emphasis on "traditional" -> yes but not only

- IUCN resolution 1988 recognising that landscapes materially altered by humans can be of great value for local biodiversity, socio-economic development and can provide the "basis for sustainable development over relatively large regions and thereby be of particular importance to many developing countries"
- IUCN 1994 new categories system revising definition of protected landscape: "an area of land [...], where the interaction of people and nature over time has produced an area of distinct character with significant aesthetic, ecological and/or cultural value, and often with high biological diversity."

:::{.notes}
- for this example, I rely on the extensive work led by @lombardoEarlyHoloceneCrop2020 [see also @lombardoMidLateHoloceneFluvial2012; @lombardoEarlyMiddleHolocene2013; @lombardoHoloceneLandCover2019], from which pictures and illustrations are taken.
- Remember this picture from the introduction slide? Well what you see at the center is artificial.

Shell middens: accumulation of organic deposition resulting from human foraging (burning evidence, omnivory markers) [@lombardoEarlyMiddleHolocene2013].

:::{.notes}
- this is what is under the trees: stratified shell middens, resulting from the accumulation of fire residuals and organic deposition
:::

## Human use

- Early to mid-Holocene period: region dominated by seasonally flooded savannahs [@lombardoHoloceneLandCover2019].
- 10,350 BP: earliest signs of *Manihot* (wild ancestor of manioc) cultivation in forest islands [@lombardoEarlyHoloceneCrop2020].
- 4,000 BP: agricultural transformation facilitated by the changes in hydrological conditions (Rio Grande shift) [@lombardoMidLateHoloceneFluvial2012].

## Implications for biodiversity

- Refuges for plants and animals during seasonal floods.
- Fertility hotspots amid the generally poor savannah soil.
- **Niche construction** [@smithNicheConstructionBehavioral2007; @smithGeneralPatternsNiche2011]: "organism-driven environmental modification" (environmental engineering).
- Contribute to landscape heterogeneity and increase connectivity between forested areas.
- Feeding and roosting sites for endemic and critically-endangered blue-throated macaw (*Ara glaucogularis*).

# Agroecological systems

## Benefits from biodiversity

- cultural values: medicine, TEK @levisContributionsHumanCultures2024

## Biodiversity associated with human intervention

### Direct

- crops & domesticated animals, adapted to the local context [@gandiniAnalysisCulturalValue2003]

# Exploiting synergies {background-image="illustrations/trial.lecture/rice.fish2.jpg" background-size="cover"}

**Rice-fish farming systems in China**

## Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS)

- "GIAHS are the result of the gradual co-evolution of local communities and their environments. In response to local challenges, communities have developed sustainable farming systems by conserving and using traditional knowledge, biodiversity and landscapes, while supporting their livelihoods and food security" (https://www.fao.org/giahs/background/en).
- Programme launched by the FAO at the World Summit for Sustainable Development in 2002, with the objective to "identify and safeguard GIAHS and their associated landscapes, agricultural biodiversity and knowledge systems".

## History and underlying mechanisms

- 6000-8000 BP: development irrigated rice cultivation [@luoBiodiversityConservationRice2014].
- Han Dynasty (2000 BP): first archaeological evidence of rice-fish co-culture.
- Rice-fish mutualistic relationships [@xieEcologicalMechanismsUnderlying2011]:
  - fish reduces insect pests, diseases and weeds, and fertilises the water.
  - rice provides shade, reduces ammonia concentration in water and hosts potential preys for the fish.
- Provides essential complex of proteins

## Domesticated fauna and flora

- Domesticated organisms: conservation of local species of rice and fish [@liuAgriculturalLandscapesBiodiversity2013].

## Biodiversity at the pond level

- Diversification trophic network
- Succession interdependent arthropod communities according to rice growth phases (pest, natural enemy, neutral) [@luoBiodiversityConservationRice2014]
- reduced use of chemicals (pesticides, fertilisation): particularly important for natural pest enemies, which have the highest diversity [@luoBiodiversityConservationRice2014]
- better water quality and higher plankton diversity [@liBiodiversitySustainabilityIntegrated2021].

## Biodiversity at the landscape level

- landscape complexity enhances total diversity and more specifically amphibians, spiders & beetles [@cambero-conejeroEffectsLandscapeComplexity2026].
- Ridge-ditch patterns enhance structural heterogeneity and support spider and wasp diversity [@liuAgriculturalLandscapesBiodiversity2013].
- impact across scale, from the water ditch to the landscape [@burgiExploringLinksCulture2015].

- Agroforestry
- Infield-outfield systems

# Involving local communities

# Summary

- Human modification/alteration of the landscape for a anthropocentric purpose
- Domesticated biodiversity
- Heterogeneity
- Adaptation

# What about post-industrial landscapes?

- Arras
- e.g. wild bees in sand mining [@lowickiNewModelPollination2021; @seitzConservingBeesDestroyed2019]

## Norwegian context

@daugstadAgricultureUpholderCultural2006
- Cultural landscape in Nordic context
  - term has been used as synonymously for agriculturally influenced landscape, especially for traditional/historical agriculture when coming from the Ministry of Environment
  - Ministry Environment, Directorate Cultural Heritage, Directorate Nature Management - cultural heritage sites & environments as expressions of our common memory that communicate knowledge about human life, activity and capacity through time -> help understand relationship between past & present, nature & man, and different cultures
