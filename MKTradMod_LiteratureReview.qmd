- All land use types (forestry, crops, green fodder) considered, intensification within low-intensity systems would not affect yield and species richness (all taxa), but stepping up to medium intensity would expose to species richness loss (-7.7% [-13.7, -1.3]) without substantial yield increase (+6% [-5, +18.3])
- Still all land use types considered: the most impactful intensification was within medium-intensity systems for both yield increase (+84.9% [+65.8, +106.1]) and species richness loss (-22.9% [-28.1, -17.4]) -> but careful, low replication level for meta-analysis (19 & 29 respectively)
- In general for green fodder systems, species richness significantly decrease under intensification (-12.4% [-21.8, -1.9]) & yield increased but not significantly (+14.2 [-5.6, +38.2]). Invertebrates particularly impacted in green fodder compared with other land uses
- land use history, taxonomic group and climatic zone covariates explained significant proportion of heterogeneity

# LANDSCAPE MULTIFUNCTIONALITY

# DIVERSITY AND FUNCTIONALITY ACROSS SCALE

ref (@habelEuropeanGrasslandEcosystems2013) 
- High-species richness in grassland explained by a combination of factors across scales. Respectively: large evolutionary species pool; intermediate position along environmental gradient; landscape heterogeneity/mass effect; continuity of habitat patches in space and time; reduction of competitive exclusion.
- Need to consider different taxa, functional groups, scales of drivers when assessing management effect on grassland biodiversity.

ref (@zelnikPlantSpeciesDiversity2013)
- plant species richness in Central European meadows was first determined by soil factors, then climatic, then topographic and finally management.
- floristic composition variance best explained by altitude, pH, flooding frequency, mean annual temperature, date of mowing, humidity, annual precipitation, available P and total N

ref (@siefertScaleDependenceVegetationenvironment2012)
- edaphic variables with highest overall primacy across scale -> the most likely to explain the most variation in plant community composition

## GEOMORPHOLOGY EFFECT

ref (@habelEuropeanGrasslandEcosystems2013) 
- Topographic wetness index negatively affected primary producers

ref (@klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007a)
- elevation, slope angle and solar radiation significant driver of plant species composition in grasslands
- sites with high soil quality opposed to those with higher slope angles
  - Frequencies of *Cardamine pratensis* & *Alopecurus pratensis* correlated with high soil quality
  - Higher frequencies of *Poa pratensis*, *Dactylis glomerata* and *Festuca pratensis* on steeper sites
- second gradient elevation - solar radiation
  - *Trifolium dubium* and *Poa angustifolia* occurred more on sites at low elevation or relatively high solar radiation
  - *Heracleum sphondylium* and *Agrostis capillaris* occurred more on sites at higher elevation or with low solar radiation

## LANDSCAPE EFFECT

ref (@leprovostContrastingResponsesBelowground2021)
- landscape-level land use the most important driver of species richness of both above and belowground trophic groups
- primary producers variance approx. equally explained by plot-level & landscape-level factors, total variance explained by model very high (50%)
- aboveground arthropod (both predators & omnivores) variance mostly explained by landscape-level factors, but total variance explained smaller (~15% for predators, ~10% for omnivores)
- grassland permanency negatively affected primary producers but positively affected arthropods (both predators and omnivores)
- insect herbivores variance best explained by wider landscape (2000 m radius) while primary producers, omnivores & predators arthropods variances were best explained by smaller-scale landscape (500 m radius)
- high land use intensity in surrounding landscape weakens the correlation between trophic groups -> disruption species interactions

## MANAGEMENT ON FIELD EFFECT

ref (@leprovostContrastingResponsesBelowground2021)
- field-level factors (plant community heterogeneity & land use temporal variation) less important drivers but sill significant
- land use intensity negatively affected primary producers diversity & insect herbivores, but omnivores and predators arthropods not significantly affected
- increase plot-level intensity reduce species richness of primary producers

## FINE-SCALE ENVIRONMENT EFFECT

ref (@klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007a)
- Nitrogen fertilization: grasslands with *Stellaria media*, *Poa annua* & *Poa trivialis* positively correlated, while *Ranunculus acris*, *Trifolium pratense* and *Rumex acetosa* negatively correlated

# MEASURING BIODIVERSITY IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES

ref (@leprovostContrastingResponsesBelowground2021)
- belowground diversity does not respond to land use intensity and change the same way as aboveground diversity. As conservative management decisions are taken in regard to aboveground diversity, it may not stimulate, if not even negatively affect belowground biota

# ECOLOGICAL METHODOLOGY

## SCALE

ref (@denglerBiodiversityPalaearcticGrasslands2014)
- Extremely diverse grasslands (particularly central Europe) can be explained by five preconditions: 1) Large evolutionary species pool; 2) Intermediate position along environmental gradients; 3) Landscape heterogeneity/mass effect; 4) Continuity of habitat patches in space and time; 5) Reduction of competitive exclusion

```

ref (@siefertScaleDependenceVegetationenvironment2012)
- Between the effects of fine-scale (e.g. edaphic) and broad-scale (e.g. climatic) factors on community data, the variance explained will depend differently on the extent and the grain of the survey. Fine-scale variation will be very high at small extent but will stabilize quickly on bigger areas, while broad-scale variation will be very low at first at increase with bigger extent. Both will decrease with higher grain, but it will be sharp and fast for fine-scale and slow for broad-scale. The influence of the latter can then be expected to increase with bigger spatial grain. There would then be a spatial grain threshold from which broad-scale variables take over fine-scale variables to explain species composition variance.

```
- New metric: multivariate effect size statistic MESS = average of correlation coefficients across multiple ordination axes, weighted by the amount of variance accounted for by each axis
- Estimated extent threshold of 2000 km^2^ or 45 km linear distance -> from where plant distribution more likely to be explained by climatic factors (e.g. temperature) than edaphic factors (e.g. pH)

## DIVERSITY VS COMMUNITY COMPOSITION

ref (@klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007a)
- variation partitioning more explanatory for species diversity than for species composition -> can be due to statistical method or actual complexity of community responses compared to diversity
