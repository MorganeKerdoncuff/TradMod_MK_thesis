# THESIS DRAFT

- **(Q1)** What is the influence of the regional environment on semi-natural grasslands and heathlands? More specifically:
  - **(Q1-1)** Can we confirm the hump-shaped productivity pattern along the coast-to-mountain gradient (**paper IV**)?
  - **(Q1-2)** Can we detect the influence of geographic or climatic factors on the taxonomic and functional composition of semi-natural grasslands (**paper II**, **paper III**, **paper IV**)?
- **(Q2)** What are the synergies and trade-offs between indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem services among semi-natural grasslands and heathlands (**paper II**, **paper III**, **paper IV**)?
- **(Q3)** Which management factor influences the diversity and community composition of semi-natural grasslands and heathlands? More specifically:
  - **(Q3-1)** Is there an effect of livestock type or grazing intensity on diversity and community composition in semi-natural grasslands (**paper II**, **paper III**)?
  - **(Q3-2)** How prescribed burning supports the conservation of semi-natural heathlands (**paper I**, **paper IV**)?* øøø

## INTRO

- importance of choosing a "yield gap closing strategy" which is embedded within local communities' cultural values and adapted to local environment and historical land use in order to prevent landscape homogenisation [@cunninghamCloseYieldgapSaving2013]
<!-- - However the areas under permanent meadows and pastures have declined during the past 60 years. The trends is particularly sharp in Europe, which suffered from a 56% decrease, from 402 000 ha in 1961 to 177 000 ha in 2020 (FAO DATA, 2020) -->
<!-- - but area covered by permanent pastures in Europe projected to immutably decrease by 2030, from 182 million ha in 1999 to at best 109 million ha, at worst 73 million ha (land sparing strategy) [@wirseniusHowMuchLand2010] -->

- to increase production following 2030 FAO scenario, expansion of grassland less likely, instead intensification relying on increase use fertiliser, grass-clover mixtures & improved management to increase grassland productivity by 33% @bouwmanExploringChangesWorld2005
- global agriculture already produce enough food but current practices undermine biodiversity - agriculture and biodiversity closely interdependent, should be addressed simultaneously @chappellFoodSecurityBiodiversity2011
- increase of micro-nutrient deficiencies in the Global South due to increase crop yield potential & N fertiliser @jonesNutrientStrippingGlobal2013

- evidence towards diet shift & optimisation input ("increase input efficiency" ~ intensification?) offering more environmental benefits than shift towards organic & grass-fed -> land sparing > land sharing @clarkComparativeAnalysisEnvironmental2017
- direct benefices of "land-sparing" limited, particularly in "developed" countries @ewersIncreasesAgriculturalYield2009
- limits of land sparing/sharing dichotomy when focus on food production instead of food security + need for more holistic framework including socio-ecological systems @fischerLandSparingLand2014
- limits of land sparing/sharing concept when national decision-making impacts other countries through globalised foodchain - need for better incorporation of ES bundle trade-offs, context-specific assessment @grauLandSparingLand2013
- to move beyond land sparing/land sharing as the two approaches are synergetic -> outdated concept @kremenReframingLandSparing2015

<!-- - outdated land sharing/land sparing framework [@fischerLandSparingLand2014; @grauLandSparingLand2013; @kremenReframingLandSparing2015] -->
<!-- There has been ongoing debate about land sharing vs land sparing (+ sustainable intensification)... -->
<!-- sustainable intensification has been presented as a solution to be able to fulfill the food production objectives (should look at: Godfray and Garnett, 2014; Cassman and Grassini, 2020) + short description of what sustainable intensification is (optimisation production, crop-based, biotech...) - also @rockstromSustainableIntensificationAgriculture2017 and @pywellWildlifefriendlyFarmingIncreases2015 -->

- land uses emissions highest in Latin America, Southeast Asia & sub-Saharan Africa due to agriculture & disproportion of red-meat product which releases 25% GHG for only 1% calories @hongGlobalRegionalDrivers2021
- "low-opportunity cost feedstuff" fed livestock under circular economy allows to set boundaries for livestock production while providing a substantial proportion of protein need @vanzantenDefiningLandBoundary2018

- renewed "peasantry" paradigm which recentre food security within local communities, restore human-nature balanced relationship -> re-emerging trend from the realisation of land limits @douwevanderploegPeasantriesTwentyfirstCentury2010
- win-win approach small-holder agroecology @fischerReframingFoodBiodiversity2017
- tackling current challenges requires diversification of farming towards multifunctionality, adaptative capacity, resilience & empowerement of communities instead of specialisation (or simplification), and potential tradeoffs should be addressed from local implication @petersen-rockneyNarrowBrittleBroad2021
- to renew our vision of farming by localising/regionalising production systems, slowing/reversing enlargement trend, need for policy focus on development & empowerement small holdings @gillerFutureFarmingWho2021
- reshaping European agriculture & food system to ensure feeding population by 2050 while securing food production & preservation environment @billenReshapingEuropeanAgrofood2021
- synergies between food security & biodiversity in the Global South dependent on land ownership, social equity & increase of social (e.g. traditional knowledge) & human (e.g. health) capital, and if conventionalised infrastructure, market & financial capital high food security but at the cost of biodiversity -> socio-ecological system approach to investigate synergies @hanspachTradeoffsSynergiesFood2017

- trade-offs yield & soil, water quality & biodiversity, but could be tackled with bottom-up approaches -> need for more context-specific evidence @germanRelationshipsMultipleAspects2017
- benefits from grasslands not only food production, but other ecosystem services such as carbon storage/climate change mitigation [@omaraRoleGrasslandsFood2012]
- relying on ES to increase food security - win-win @bommarcoExploitingEcosystemServices2018

- decline of carrying capacity on 27% global grassland, stronger in Europe @piipponenGlobalTrendsGrassland2022

- negative impact of intensification on biodiversity in Europe [@kleijnRelationshipFarmlandBiodiversity2009]
- European cultural landscape is a complex & intertwined network of mosaics resulting from a multi-layered historical use [@vosTrendsEuropeanCultural1999]
- reshaping European agriculture & food system to ensure feeding population by 2050 while securing food production & preservation environment @billenReshapingEuropeanAgrofood2021
<!-- - All remaining high nature conservation value grasslands across Europe associated with low-intensity livestock systems [@bignalLowintensityFarmingSystems1996] -->
- Principal threats are agriculture intensification and land abandonment [@bignalLowintensityFarmingSystems1996], which lead to the homogenisation of the European agricultural landscape by the loss of regional biological and cultural diversity [@jongmanHomogenisationFragmentationEuropean2002]
- Semi-natural habitats such as Northern meadows or Fennoscandian pastures are fully dependent on agricultural management [@haladaWhichHabitatsEuropean2011]
<!-- - Agricultural habitats have on average a poorer conservation status compared to other habitats [@haladaWhichHabitatsEuropean2011] -->
<!-- - however, increasing the food production in some European countries to the FAO objective (+ 10%) would not even be possible even if all the semi-natural habitats were converted into croplands, as for example in Germany, Italy and Austria (@jeanneretIncreaseFoodProduction2021) -->

- there are also limits to the crop-based approach:
    <!-- - a production-based strategy will also have a high environmental impact, including land degradation and biodiversity loss [@hunterAgriculture2050Recalibrating2017] + some others) -->
- To counteract the current trend where land use is driven by market and technology instead of local environmental conditions and population needs, there is need for multifunctional use of the land and landscape planning [@jongmanHomogenisationFragmentationEuropean2002]
- This would need both regional and global collaboration, as 60% and 88% of biodiversity loss projection would be avoided under national and global optimisation scenarii respectively [@egliWinnersLosersNational2018]
- UNESCO MAB - Biosphere Reserve network as a great playground to experiment regional landscape planning & develop international collaboration ;-)
- maybe need to develop slightly on SDGs & 2030 Agenda
- Some examples here + blabla on us

The livestock sector holds key responsibilities as it accounts for the largest land use [@kastnerGlobalChangesDiets2012], global demand for animal products is still predicted to increase, even in the Global North [@alexandratosWorldAgriculture20302012], leading to further pressure over planetary boundaries [@newboldHasLandUse2016; @pelletierForecastingPotentialGlobal2010; @richardsonEarthSixNine2023]. Globalised grain-feed based systems have been growing relentlessly for the past 50 years following market demand, despite poor return in calorie and nutritional needs [@cassidyRedefiningAgriculturalYields2013; @ramankuttyTrendsGlobalAgricultural2018] and at the expense of severe environmental externalities mostly shouldered by the Global South [@cunninghamCloseYieldgapSaving2013; @hongGlobalRegionalDrivers2021; @jonesNutrientStrippingGlobal2013; @naylorLosingLinksLivestock2005]. In parallel pasture-based husbandry has either intensified or declined, leading to the decrease and degradation of global grassland area [@liNewGlobalLanduse2017; @liuAnnualDynamicsGlobal2020; @wirseniusHowMuchLand2010] and subsequent loss in productivity [@kwonGlobalEstimatesImpacts2016; @liuAssessingEffectsClimate2019; @piipponenGlobalTrendsGrassland2022], multifunctionality [@bardgettCombattingGlobalGrassland2021; @steffan-dewenterTradeoffsIncomeBiodiversity2007] and biodiversity [@newboldGlobalEffectsLand2015; @newboldHasLandUse2016].
- such conversions sacrifice habitats of high conservation values [@bignalLowintensityFarmingSystems1996; @haladaWhichHabitatsEuropean2011]. As such, promoting pasture-based husbandry in the Global North would serve the complementary purposes of benefiting regional biodiversity while alleviating the crop burden of the Global South hotspots [@foleySolutionsCultivatedPlanet2011; @haberlQuantifyingMappingHuman2007; @kehoeGlobalPatternsAgricultural2015; @zabelGlobalImpactsFuture2019].


## Chapter 1 - Norwegian small-scale agriculture

### Small-scale farming in Western Norway

- evolution of farming - 1. traditional pluriactivity, without incentives neither other aims than surviving - 2. post-war productivism, which led to increase farm size  - 3. new diversification with added cultural values, this time acknowledged & regulated by public authorities [@daugstadAgricultureUpholderCultural2006]
- Collapse of agricultural holdings since the mid-20th century, from ~200,000 to ~50,000, with a decline of wholly owned holdings and an exponential increase of mainly rented holdings which represent bigger areas with more livestock [@forbordDriversChangeNorwegian2014; SSB]
- small-scale arrangements make particular mutually beneficial relationship between farmer and land-owner in Norway [@forbordDriversChangeNorwegian2014]
- decline of the "traditional" small-scale farming system in Norway with a combined use of livestock and hay-meadows [@wehnAdaptiveBiodiversityManagement2018]
- traditional practices, such as different hay-cutting dates across farms, could enhance heterogeneity between meadows [@wehnAdaptiveBiodiversityManagement2018]
- decrease of livestock leads to biodiversity loss in highly-diversified hay meadows of Western Norway, as it represented the direct economic use of hay & also controlled trampling and fertilisation [@wehnAdaptiveBiodiversityManagement2018]
- Land use history in Western Norway - [@bakkaEarlyFarmingHordaland1971; @hamreLandcoverStructuralChanges2007; @hjelleHesitantHuntersReview2006]
- How grazing systems in Western Norway respond to traditional land use principles [@plieningerTraditionalLanduseNature2006]:
    - Multiple use: farmers usually have a mixed system, with livestock, forest & crop (can rely on some examples from gårdskart)
    - Rotational use: inmark/utmark, also rotations between fields in the same area & between animals
    - Recycling: low nutrient inputs, again inmark/utmark process
    - Low-energy economy: small-scale farming, not much mechanical interference
    - Spatial fuzziness: interactions between different land use structures (e.g. grassland & forest) and processes
- Here I should develop more about heathlands & the utmark system, with literature from Vigdis & Inger & Kari Hjelle
- infield-outfield system provided an exceptionally high level of biodiversity of habitat, species, genetics & landscape [@olssonAgroecosystemsNeolithicTime1991]

### The spectrum traditional - alternative - low-intensive - small-scale farming

Traditional small-scale or low-intensive farming systems represent an alternative to conventional agriculture. According to @plieningerTraditionalLanduseNature2006, traditional farming relies on the following principles: 1. the multiple use of the land, through polyculture and interactions between private, common and public stakeholders; 2. the rotational use of the land, with both spatial and temporal changes; 3. the recycling of outputs into inputs; 4. the energy and resource scarcity of the whole system, including externalities; 5. the spatial fuzziness resulting from intertwined land use structures and processes.

- Traditional agroecosystems, often mixed or agroforestry (+ ref to concrete examples in the South), as learning models for sustainable food production [@altieriEcologicalRoleBiodiversity1999; @altieriLinkingEcologistsTraditional2004]
- Relationship between land use intensity and biodiversity loss not always straightforward - some productive land use can also support relatively high biodiversity [@cunninghamCloseYieldgapSaving2013]
- "Traditional" grazing should not be characterized per se as low-intensity, especially in highly populated areas, though high biodiversity can still be hosted thanks to many nutrient & input gradients at local & regional scales [@plieningerTraditionalLanduseNature2006]
- Low-intensity farmlands are characterized by low nutrient inputs & low output per hectare [@bignalLowIntensityFarmingSystems1996]
- Traditional farming has shaped the landscape through involution [@vosTrendsEuropeanCultural1999], by adapting management practices to natural environment [@bignalLowIntensityFarmingSystems1996], in opposition to conventional agriculture which "replace" existing landscapes thanks to technological advances which give control over natural conditions
- Even in small-scale systems, changes in management with the use of fertilizers and seed mixtures, which can still affect species diversity [@beckmannConventionalLandUse2019]. In our case, only 4 of our infields were without any sort of treatment apart from grazing.

### Cultural landscapes and traditional agriculture

- Categorisation of cultural landscape by the World Heritage Convention [see  @phillipsNatureCulturalLandscapes1998]
- With time, the primary role of agricultural areas, which represented the main labour supplier for food production, has declined at the same time as new demands have raised, such as recreation & nature conservation [@vosTrendsEuropeanCultural1999]
- the concept cultural landscape used to be closely related to agricultural lands, including both infields and outfields, and only more recently that the term expanded to include urban areas. Ministry of Environment still has the tendency to associate traditional/historic farming to cultural landscape [@daugstadAgricultureUpholderCultural2006]

## Chapter 2.1 - Accounting for the climate-landform gradient of the fjord system

### Habitat productivity

(1) Site productivity was as expected a strong factor of variation of soil nutrient cycling [**ref**] and plant functional group diversity [@bakkerHerbivoreImpactGrassland2006; @debelloGrazingEffectsSpecies2007; @lezamaVariationGrazinginducedVegetation2014], but higher heterogeneity amongst outfields was seemingly not related to geographical location (PIV) despite sharp differences in temperature and precipitation between the coast and the moutains [@meteorologiskinstituttNorskKlimaservicesenter2023]. Climate effect could be buffered by the high in-field heterogeneity of outfields [@negronConsequencesIntensiveGrazing2019], with similar mosaic of ecological conditions met at both ends of the gradient through for instance topographic complexity [@graaeStayGoHow2018; @mysterudEffectsDensitySeason2007], grazing [@augustineFeedbacksSoilNutrients2003; @hopcraftHerbivoresResourcesRisks2010] or concurring management practices such as rotational prescribed burning on the coast (PI).

- Climate can also interact with grazing as water availability affects digestible quality of plant biomass [@hopcraftHerbivoresResourcesRisks2010], and sheep foraging patterns in higher elevation are influenced by the weather [@mysterudEffectsDensitySeason2007].
- We did not consider ground-dwelling arthropods, for which temperature can be important driver along elevation gradient [@sandersTemperatureNotProductivity2007]
- Site productivity can for instance alter plant species richness response to grazing even across a shorter gradient [@pakemanLongTermImpacts2019].
- influence depends on plant functional type [@austrheimPlantDiversityPatterns2002] -> e.g. vascular & cryptogams responding differently to elevation and soil nutrient/LOI
- temperature interacted with soil moisture & soil improvement for total herbage mass @negronConsequencesIntensiveGrazing2019
- in savanna, stronger interaction rainfall x primary production when cattle-grazed than abandoned [@augustineFeedbacksSoilNutrients2003]
- environmental variables (site productivity, evolutionary grazing history) more important than grazing variables (consumption) to plant species composition [@milchunasQuantitativeEffectsGrazing1993]
- change in plant species composition & richness under grazing against no grazing more important on high productivity sites [@lezamaVariationGrazinginducedVegetation2014]
- grazing increase plant species richness in high productive sites but decrease in low productive sites, even if number of exclusive species increases in both cases [@bakkerHerbivoreImpactGrassland2006]

### Species distribution

(2) When only considering infields, we did not find any effect of the landscape zone on vascular plant species richness (PII), but the relationships with assemblage and functional trait composition were not as straightforward. If we found signs of potential influence of the regional gradient over plant (PII, PIII) and beetle (PIII) assemblages as well as forage indicator value (PII), there were either contradicted by complementary analyses (PIII) or dependent on the interaction with the livestock type (PII). Even though temperature and precipitation can affect both plant [@reitaluDeterminantsFinescalePlant2014; @turtureanuScaleTaxondependentBiodiversity2014; @zelnikPlantSpeciesDiversity2013] and animal [@dauberLocalVsLandscape2005; @filazzolaEffectsLivestockGrazing2020] diversity and assemblage composition in grazing fields, regional phenomena may have weaker influence over shorter geographical ranges compared with grazing management or edaphic variables [@siefertScaleDependenceVegetationenvironment2012; PIII]. Local weather and topography could still indirectly affect plant species composition [@andersonRainfallSoilsModify2007] by constraining livestock foraging behaviour [@hesterForagingBehaviourSheep1999; @mysterudEffectsDensitySeason2007] or nutrient and water distribution [**ref**], but it was not verified in our survey (PIII).

- No relationship between rainfall, plant biomass & soil available N & P independently of grazing of native ungulates in Tanzania, but combined effect of rain & grazing on species turnover [@andersonRainfallSoilsModify2007]
- floristic composition affected by annual precipitation & mean annual temperature @zelnikPlantSpeciesDiversity2013
- richness of plant functional groups varied to temperature minimum & annual range @turtureanuScaleTaxondependentBiodiversity2014
- variation staphylinids most explained by temperature @dauberLocalVsLandscape2005
- local environment & biogeographic variables accounted for largest fractions of variability in plant species richness @reitaluDeterminantsFinescalePlant2014
- animal diversity & abundance affected by temperature but not by precipitation @filazzolaEffectsLivestockGrazing2020

### Land use

(3) We found on the other hand a clear correlation between the climate-landform gradient and the land cover surrounding infields (PIII), supporting that the agro-ecological landscape matrix in the NBR fjord system is strongly environmentally constrained [@lundbergAustevollChangingCoastal1991; @nesjeFjordsNorwayComplex2009]. However, this change in landscape composition did not affect finer environmental gradients [**ref**] neither dominant plant [@cousinsModellingEffectsLandscape2003; @soderstromPlantsInsectsBirds2001] or beetle [@avironCarabidAssemblagesAgricultural2005; @bataryResponsesGrasslandSpecialist2007; @martelImpactFarmingSystems2019] assemblages (PIII). If the influence of landscape is not always verified compared with local variables [@dauberLandscapeStructureIndicator2003; @jeanneretQuantifyingImpactLandscape2003], other features than composition can be more significant such as connectivity [@concepcionEffectsLandscapeComplexity2008; @cousinsHotspotsAreGone2008; @schweigerQuantifyingImpactEnvironmental2005], heterogeneity [@burelDifferentialResponseSelected2004; @dramstadIntegratingLandscapebasedValues2001; @zulkaSpeciesRichnessDry2014], configuration [@lecoqLandscapeStructureInfluences2023] or complexity [@cloughFieldSizesFuture2020; @gonthierBiodiversityConservationAgriculture2014].

- Likewise, temporal consideration/historical assessments are suitable
- Such spatially-explicit frameworks offer/can support/are suitable for exploring a wide range of strategies/approaches, as for instance the impact of historical connectivity and continuity/land use history [@leprovostLanduseHistoryImpacts2020; @lindborgHistoricalLandscapeConnectivity2004] and temporal continuity [@hamrePlantSpeciesRichness2010; @woodcockHistoricalLocalLandscape2021]

- effect of landscape not always consistent - e.g. @dramstadIntegratingLandscapebasedValues2001 vs @gonthierBiodiversityConservationAgriculture2014
- multidiversity (plant + arthropod) positively affected by landscape heterogeneity [@zulkaSpeciesRichnessDry2014]
- landscape effect depends on organims mobility [@weibullSpeciesCompositionAgroecosystems2003]
- landscape effect may be bigger when considering fields with lower "naturality level", such as fodder crop [@jonsenResponseGeneralistSpecialist1997]
- landscape variability, heterogeneity & pattern did not show any influence on carabid and spider assemblage composition in different habitat types within agricultural landscape [@jeanneretQuantifyingImpactLandscape2003]
- landscape matrix did not affect plant species diversity [@dauberLandscapeStructureIndicator2003]
- landscape intensification & homogenisation affected carabid communities towards smaller, more mobile and ubiquitous species [@burelDifferentialResponseSelected2004]
- landscape features influence on community composition of plants & butterflies differs according to the type of habitat [@weibullSpeciesCompositionAgroecosystems2003]
- landscape effect on butterfly & carabid species richness significant for conventionally managed farms, but not for organic farms [@weibullSpeciesRichnessAgroecosystems2003]

### Field gradient

At finer scale, grazing effect on plant community and richness is likely to vary according to field productivity [@lezamaVariationGrazinginducedVegetation2014; @zulkaSpeciesRichnessDry2014] and soil nutrient distribution [@klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007a; @siefertScaleDependenceVegetationenvironment2012], controlled by, amongst other, climate [**REF**], topography [@dorroughPlantNeighbourhoodLandscape2007; @klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007a; @kleinebeckerEffectsGrazingSeasonal2011] and management [@bakkerDoesResourceAvailability2003; @kleinebeckerEffectsGrazingSeasonal2011].

In paper I, we used heath regeneration stages to represent differences in vegetation height, ground cover, humidity and litter layer following small-scale prescribed burning [@barclay-estrupDescriptionInterpretationCyclical1969; @nilsenEarlyStagesCalluna2005].

soil
- edaphic factors are the most likely to explain the most variation in plant community composition [@siefertScaleDependenceVegetationenvironment2012]
- soil properties still explain significant variation of soil fauna abundance independently of geographical location and land use type [@birkhoferGeneralRelationshipsAbiotic2012]
- N fertilisation affect plant species composition [@klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007a]

## Chapter 2.2 - Characterising grazing management in small-scale grazing systems

### What to expect

- Redefinition small-scale grazing system - key words: low-intensity, rotational, mixed livestock, complementary management

### What we found

- We tested
- type of livestock (PII, PIII)
- stocking density (PIII)
- complementary practices (PI, PIV)

- If both papers suggested that grazing management had an influence on plant species composition, with different vascular plant species composition in sites grazed by cows (PII) and a significant correlation between grazing management and dominant grass communities in infields (PIII), it is difficult to assure that grazing itself is actually the direct driver.
-  First of all, the relationship between dominant grass species and the set of grazing management variables in paper III was supported in the first step by the canonical correlation analysis, but not by the subsequent redundancy analysis.
- Then, in paper II, if a different plant species composition was associated with cow-grazed infields, it does not mean that cows themselves were the driver of change.
- Indeed, we recorded from the farmer interviews (data not available at the time of PII submission) that cow fields were more heavily fertilised than fields grazed by other animals.
- Thus, on outfields which are less intensively managed, role of grazers maybe more prominent
- [PIV findings, with outfields vs infields]
- Habitat productivity is an important element [@milchunasQuantitativeEffectsGrazing1993], with potential interactions with grazers [@lezamaVariationGrazinginducedVegetation2014]
- In paper II, coastal fields grazed by sheep had lower fodder productivity (PII)
- on low-productive coastal heathland, combination of grazing and fire did influence beetle activity even at fine-scale, even if it did not seem to fundamentally modify the community


#### Grazing

Land use intensification
- Belowground multidiversity less affected by land-use intensification or interannual variation [@allanInterannualVariationLanduse2014]
- no effect of N & P on plant species composition in Tanzanian grasslands grazed by native ungulates [@andersonRainfallSoilsModify2007]

Grazing x no grazing
- overall negative impact of grazing on beta-diversity, affecting more strongly highly productive sites [@lezamaVariationGrazinginducedVegetation2014]
- no clear effect of grazing on graminoid cover, independently of site productivity [@lezamaVariationGrazinginducedVegetation2014]
- decrease of plant species richness along with increase of soil available P with ungulate exclusion [@andersonRainfallSoilsModify2007]
- grazing affect abiotic interactions soil x site & x flooding regime [@graceRelationshipSpeciesDensity1999]

Grazing intensity
- grazing intensity affected plant community in 15y experiment upland grassland but sensitivity depended on community type [@pakemanLongTermImpacts2019]
- intensive cattle grazing increased legumes abundance & evenness & decreased grass abundance compared with extensive in 6y grassland experiments [@dumontPlantHerbivoreInteractions2011]
- light to moderate grazing usually most productive, but even heavy grazing can be equally productive depending on the type of grassland [@pattonEffectsGrazingIntensity2007]
- low-intensity sheep grazing in Mediterranean grasslands with higher plant species richness than moderate and high intensity [@skornikEffectGrazingPressure2010]
- different plant species composition under heavy grazing, but not between light & moderate [@skornikEffectGrazingPressure2010]
- no overall *effect of sheep grazing intensity on plant species richness & Shannon in meta-analysis of sheep-grazed grasslands [@scohierHowSheepAffect2012]
- distribution of CSR strategies primarily affected by grazing intensity in Canadian marshes & wet meadows [@teuberLivestockGrazingIntermountain2013]
- light to moderate grazing intensity (0.7-2.4 LSU/ha) affected bite rate but not forage selectivity in cattle-grazed mesotrophic & semi-natural grasslands [@dumontEffectsLivestockBreed2007]
- light to moderate grazing intensity (0.7-2.4 LSU/ha) only very marginally affected plant species richness & cover of functional groups & dominant species in cattle-grazed mesotrophic & semi-natural grasslands [@scimoneEffectsLivestockBreed2007]
- effect of light to moderate grazing intensity (0.7-2.4 LSU/ha) on ground-dwelling arthropod overall not consistent and mostly dependent from location and grassland type [@wallisdevriesEffectsLivestockBreed2007]
- only very marginal effect of grazing intensity on ground beetle community composition & richness in upland grasslands [@pozsgaiGrazingImpactsGround2022]

Mixed vs single grazing
- Belowground multidiversity (bacteria, fungi, nematodes) not affected by mixed cattle-sheep grazing against single, while aboveground & total multidiversity were [@wangDiversifyingLivestockPromotes2019]
- higher total multidiversity & multifunctionality in mixed sheep & cattle grazing [@wangDiversifyingLivestockPromotes2019]
- No effect of mixed-grazing on plant composition, & no difference between cattle and sheep on plant biomass
[@jerrentrupDiverseSwardsMixedgrazing2020]
- no consistent effect of mixed-grazing/single on herbage consumption in experiment [@seitherSwardCompositionGrazer2012]
- No indication of complementarity between sheep & cattle on mixed-grazing [@jerrentrupLittleGrazerSpecies2015]
- mixed grazing increased diversity, productivity & plant community dissimilarity compared with single sheep & cattle grazing in high-diversity steppe, but no clear effects in low-diversity steppe [@liuImpactsGrazingDifferent2015]

Livestock type
- higher N yields in herbage mass in experimental cattle-grazed yards [@seitherSwardCompositionGrazer2012]
- lower plant species richness, Shannon diversity & evenness under sheep grazing compared to cow grazing [@tothLivestockTypeMore2016]
- Lower cover of short-lived & perennial forbs, and legume in sheep-grazed [@tothLivestockTypeMore2016]
- Higher multi-trait functional diversity (Rao’s quadratic entropy) in cattle-grazed [@tothLivestockTypeMore2016]
- no effect of grazer type on plant species richness on experiment [@jerrentrupLittleGrazerSpecies2015]
- higher grass abundance & evenness in sheep grazing compared with cattle after 6y treatment in grassland experiment [@dumontPlantHerbivoreInteractions2011]
- no clear effect livestock type (sheep vs cattle) on six common foraging species [@cuchillohilarioForageSelectivityCattle2018]
- no effect of livestock type (sheep vs cattle) on plant main groups cover in a 7y experiment in *Molinia* grassland [@fraserImpactSwardComposition2011]
-> farm model varies according to the livestock: usually mixed dairy-beef systems on full-time larger farms while sheep grazing on part-time, smaller farm [@asheimPolicyMeasuresPreserve2020]

Seasonal x continuous
- different plant species composition between cattle rotational and continuous grazing [@boavistaEffectsGrazingRegimes2019]
- higher species richness & evenness under cattle rotational grazing [@boavistaEffectsGrazingRegimes2019]
- no demonstrated benefits of rotational grazing compared with continuous grazing in rangeland experimental research [@briskeRotationalGrazingRangelands2008]
- rotational cattle grazing system increased plant diversity, soil nutrient content & cover of N-poor high-elevation & meso-eutrophic species in sub-alpine & alpine meadows [@perottiYearRotationalGrazing2018]
- no difference in beetle, ant & spider species richness but effect on beetle body size & ecological preferences (shade) & spider body size & hunting strategy (web vs runner) between continuous & late (mid-July) grazing in Nordic grasslands [@lenoirEffectsTimingGrazing2010]
- no sign of better biomass recovery at the end of the season under late grazing compared with early grazing in mountain grasslands [@davisEffectsTimingGrazing2014]
- late cattle grazing enhanced fruit production compared with all season in two grasslands [@lennartssonEffectTimingGrassland2012]

Productivity
- different effect of grazing intensity depending on nutrient status of the ecosystem, with plant species richness nutrient-poor habitats more sensitive to increase grazing [@proulxReversalGrazingImpact1998]
- stronger responses of herbage production & plant community structure to grazing intensity in highly productive mesotrophic grasslands compared to more species-rich ones [@isselsteinEffectsLivestockBreed2007]
- grazing effect on moisture preference & leaf-hopper activity-density habitat/productivity dependent in alkaline steppe & meadows [@tormaDifferencesArthropodCommunities2023]
- low-intensity cattle grazing (1 ind/ha) effect on plant diversity & species composition depends on habitat type (dry, meso & wet) in alkali meadows [@torokTraditionalCattleGrazing2014]
- negative effects of abandonment & fertilisation on wet meadow taxonomic diversity & functional evenness enhanced in more productive sites [@janecekEffectsLanduseChanges2013]

Fertilisation
- N redistribution [@augustineFeedbacksSoilNutrients2003]: in managed habitat, N deposition through dung & urine exceeded total N consumption in forage while in bushland, N forage consumed exceeded N deposition
- light availability & heterogeneity may be bigger drivers than N concentration [@bakkerDoesResourceAvailability2003]
- N fertilisation affect plant species composition [@klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007]
- mites & to lesser extent collembola most abundant in acidic soils with low nitrate concentration [@birkhoferGeneralRelationshipsAbiotic2012]


#### Depends on biodiversity attribute

- 3 primary attributes of biodiversity are composition, structure & function @nossIndicatorsMonitoringBiodiversity1990

species richness x community composition
- in wet Moliniea meadows different drivers plant species richness (soil > climate > topography > management) & composition (elevation > pH > flooding frequency > temp > mowing date > humidity > precipitation > P > N) [@zelnikPlantSpeciesDiversity2013]
- in Mediterranean grasslands, plant species diversity differed between low, moderate & high grazing intensity while community composition only differed in high intensity [@skornikEffectGrazingPressure2010]
- variation partitioning more explanatory for species diversity than for species composition -> can be due to statistical method or actual complexity of community responses compared to diversity [@klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007]
- landscape elements more influential on community composition of ground & dung beetles than species diversity [@soderstromPlantsInsectsBirds2001]
- contrary to species richness, most community structures (plants, beetles, butterflies) driven along infield tree cover gradient & % arable fields in landscape [@soderstromPlantsInsectsBirds2001]
- Carabidae species diversity responded to sheep & goat grazing intensity while community composition primarily responded to elevation gradient (0-2200 m) in Mediterranean shrubland [@kaltsasGroundBeetlesRespond2013]
- big shift in community composition may have only little effect on richnesss, evenness & diversity [@avolioChangesPlantCommunity2014]
- beetle and spider community composition responded to fertilisation in subalpine meadow but not species richness [@lessard-therrienImpactsManagementIntensification2018]

Diversity vs abundance
- only ground beetle abundance clearly responded to sheep grazing intensity in upland grasslands [@pozsgaiGrazingImpactsGround2022]  
- low grazing intensity decreased Shannon & Simpson diversity but increased abundance & biomass in comparison with 15y abandonment & moderate grazing [@tonelliEffectsProgressiveAbandonment2018]

Diversity indexes (alpha vs beta vs gamma)
- alpha diversity of semi-natural grasslands increased with proportion & diversity of natural & semi-natural habitats in the neighbourhood, while beta & gamma diversity increased with proportion & diversity of non-natural habitats [@janisovaLandscapeEffectsDiversity2014]

Functional vs taxonomic diversity
- functional diversity more temporally stable than taxonomic diversity under increasing grazing intensity, but still affected when intensity high in environments with limiter water availability @carmonaTaxonomicalFunctionalDiversity2012
- grazing intensity directly influenced both taxonomical & functional richness in sub-alpine & alpine grasslands, but not functional dispersion or evenness [@komacFunctionalDiversityGrazing2015]
- effect continuous vs late grazing mostly reflected in functional diversity of arthropods rather than species richness [@lenoirEffectsTimingGrazing2010]
- distribution of CSR strategies primarily affected by grazing intensity in Canadian marshes & wet meadows [@teuberLivestockGrazingIntermountain2013]
- area of historically preserved species-rich grasslands in the landscape affected arthropod species richness but did not filter specific traits [@woodcockHistoricalLocalLandscape2021]
- morphological traits, particularly linked to dispersal, good indicators of species responses to management intensity at both local and landscape scales [@neffCrossscaleEffectsLand2019]
- species & functional diversity highly (+) correlated in alpine Mediterranean grasslands [@catorciEffectsGrazingVs2014]

- species density & biomass in meadows do not respond to the same predictors [@graceRelationshipSpeciesDensity1999]


#### Depends on taxa

Plant vs arthropod
- plant richness more sensitive to local management intensification than invertebrates & vertebrates, while the latter significantly correlated with landscape complexity contrary to the former [@gonthierBiodiversityConservationAgriculture2014]
- no correlation between species richness of ant, wild bee & vascular plant when assessing for influence landscape matrix on grassland diversity [@dauberLandscapeStructureIndicator2003]
- no significant correlation between plant & ground beetle species richness in light cattle & sheep grazed calcareous grasslands [@lyonsImpactsContrastingConservation2017]
- plant & ground beetle community response to grazing management significantly correlated but not strongly enough to be considered as proxy in light cattle & sheep grazed calcareous grasslands [@lyonsImpactsContrastingConservation2017]
- different taxa (butterflies, carabids, plants) preferentially responded to different landscape features [@weibullSpeciesCompositionAgroecosystems2003]
- some common driver of diversity (e.g. vol juniper shrubs for butterflies, bumblebees & dung beetles, or number tree species for plants & dung beetles) and community composition (e.g. % arable fields in landscape for vascular plants & dung beetle, tree cover for vascular plants, dung beetles & ground beetles) [@soderstromPlantsInsectsBirds2001]
- landscape matrix effect NS for plants but had effect on ants through % forest & fallow lands, and on wild bees through % arable lands [@dauberLandscapeStructureIndicator2003]
- plant & spider species richness showed opposite response to land use, nitrogen content & moisture, with spiders favoured by fallows & plants more diverse in meadow & pasture [@bucherBiodiversityLowintensityPastures2016]

Arthropod vs arthropod
- only Coleoptera abundance/richness showed positive to negative responses to grazing against no grazing or grazing intensity increase while Orthoptera, Lepidoptera, Hemiptera & Aranea abundance/richness only showed neutral to positive responses in sheep-grazed grassland meta-analysis [@scohierHowSheepAffect2012]
- both spider & ground-beetle abundance & community composition responded to fertilisation on sub-alpine meadow but ground-beetle community more site-specific than spider [@lessard-therrienImpactsManagementIntensification2018]
- epigeic & ground-dwelling arthropod diversity responded differently to vegetation clipping but both assemblage composition were driven by light incidence & average humidity in sandy mixed-grass prairie [@pratherPlantsRegulateGrassland2019]
- leaf-hopper more sensitive to low-intensive grazing vs no grazing than ground beetle or spider in alkaline meadows & steppe [@tormaDifferencesArthropodCommunities2023]
- Auchenorrhyncha most sensitive taxa to local & landscape management compared with Heteroptera & Orthroptera [@neffCrossscaleEffectsLand2019]

Aboveground vs belowground
- Belowground multidiversity (bacteria, fungi, nematodes) not affected by mixed cattle-sheep grazing against single, while aboveground & total multidiversity were [@wangDiversifyingLivestockPromotes2019]
- belowground diversity does not respond to land use intensity and change the same way as aboveground diversity. As conservative management decisions are taken in regard to aboveground diversity, it may not stimulate, if not even negatively affect belowground biota [@leprovostContrastingResponsesBelowground2021]
- Belowground multidiversity less affected by land-use intensification or interannual variation [@allanInterannualVariationLanduse2014]

Multidiversity
- multidiversity response to increasing land use intensity differs according to taxonomic groups [@allanInterannualVariationLanduse2014]
- only insect abundance showed significant responses to farming intensity & landscape complexity, while overall abundance following the same trends [@gonthierBiodiversityConservationAgriculture2014]

Functional type
- different responses of bryophyte & lichen richness to humus content, & vascular & lichen to micro-relief [@turtureanuScaleTaxondependentBiodiversity2014]
- vascular & cryptogams responding differently to elevation and soil nutrient/LOI [@austrheimPlantDiversityPatterns2002]
- change in plant species composition under rotational cattle grazing not detected when overall community considered but still significant for mesotrophic, oligotrophic & thermic groups in subalpine & alpine meadows [@perottiYearRotationalGrazing2018]
- tall annual & perennial grasses decreased with cattle grazing intensity while annual thistles (chardons) & crucifers increased in Mediterranean meadows [@sternbergVegetationResponseGrazing2000]
- all arthropod feeding guilds positively affected by % historically preserved species rich grassland in landscape either independently or with interaction [@woodcockHistoricalLocalLandscape2021]


# FOOD PRODUCTION

## GLOBAL AGRICULTURE & FOOD DEMAND

@rockneyNarrowBrittleBroad2021

@gillerFutureFarmingWho2021
- AIM: review/opinion piece to investigate the interrelations between farms & farming systems globally, beyond production principles
- Trends in farming
  - Two main pathways for increase farm economic size
    - "intensification": when capital investment in technology is used to increase output with only limited physical footprint
    - "expansion": when capital investment in technology is used to largely increase physical farm size
  - "extensification": increase in farm physical size without increase in input or technology, usually to compensate low productivity
- Common patterns
  - Productivity/economic development: decrease yield gap with increase GDP per capita
  - Agriculture dependency/economic development: strong inverse relationship between agricultural employment & labour productivity
  - Fluidity of farming: limitations of fixed, rigid farm unit, when interchange of land is common practice
- Who are the farmers of the future
  - limitations to focus on production principles (agro-ecological, organic, regenerative, "conventional"...) rather than relationships within food system & between agricultural practices
  - poor definition of the "conventional" farming, which represents very diverse realities in different part of the world
  - regionalisation food production -> desirable but needs support of adapted policies

@zabelGlobalAgriculturalLand2014
- AIM: to model future land suitability for crop for current (1981-2010) & future (2071-2100) climatic conditions
- Current: 91% all suitable land already occupied by agriculture -> expansion will require substitution with other land uses
- Future: 
  - suitability improves on 18.7 Mkm^2^ vs declines on 22.2 Mkm^2^
  - more suitable area in the North, e.g. Canada, Russia & China
  - highest loss suitability in Sub-Saharan Africa & Mediterranea

@clarkComparativeAnalysisEnvironmental2017
- AIM: meta-analysis of life cycle assessments comparing agricultural systems in relation to GHG emission, environmental indicators & nutritional units
- Environmental impact alternative production systems
  - organic vs conventional (n=46)
    - land use organic 25-110% >* conventional
    - energy organic 15% <* conventional
    - eutrophication potential 37% organic >* conventional
    - NS GHG or acidification
  - grass-fed vs grain-fed beef (n=7): only land use grass-fed >* grain-fed, NS for others
- Higher agricultural input efficiency in non-ruminant livestock systems consistently associated with lower environmental impacts (included input's own impact)
- Food type: food with low impact for one environmental indicator tend to have low impacts for all indicators

@vandijkMetaanalysisProjectedGlobal2021
- AIM: meta-analysis projection global food consumption 2010-2050
- Total food consumption 2050: +35%-56%
- Total food demand considering climate change uncertainty: +30%-62% (but not significantly different without climate)
- Conclusions balance previsions from FAO, 2009 (70%) & Tilman et al. 2011 (100-110%) which promote technological solutions over agroecological approach

@theinternationalbankforreconstructionanddevelopmentWorldDevelopmentReport2007
- AIM: report on global agriculture development
- In developing countries, shift from extensive grazing to intensive stall-fed husbandry
- Agriculture & aquaculture revolution, increasing protein supply & diversifying diets, but risks of increasing waste pollution & disease outburst due to growing concentrations of animals near urban & peri-urban areas

@hunterAgriculture2050Recalibrating2017
- AIM: new prediction models on crop production to 2050 & environmental impact
- Production increase of 25-70% above current levels may be enough to meet 2050 demand, may should be strictly constrained by limitation of environmental impacts
- CONCLUSION: need to consider both goals of increased production and limitation (if not decrease) of environmental impact & land degradation

@foleySolutionsCultivatedPlanet2011
- AIM: solution on how to solve food production and land degradation dilemma
- Global increase of croplands and pastures by 3% between 1985 and 2005, but not homogeneously across the globe (even decrease in temperate zone)
- Crop production: 62% (mass) to human, 35% to livestock, 3% to bioenergy & others
- Disparity between Global North & South, with only 40% of crop to direct food production in Western countries vs 80% in Asia & Africa
- Careful with the crop-crop-crop strategy, while developing pastures would provide calories, jobs and food security
![](illustrations/Foley.etal2011_WhatAgricultureShouldAimFor_ConceptModel.png)
- Transformation of agriculture should reduce GHG, biodiversity & habitat loss, unsustainable water withdrawals & chemical pollution
- Increasing food production in non-tropical zones may reduce pressure on tropical forests
->	Switch from grain-fed to pasture-fed animals would enhance food availability. Not just about producing more, but how we produce

FAO DATA 2020
- Decrease in land under permanent meadows and pastures during past 20 years, from 3 388 k to 3 183 k (6%), level we had in 1973
- 2001-2020: 33% Asia; 26% Africa; 24% America; 11% Oceania; 5% Europe (177 k)
- 1981-2000: 28% Asia; 26% Africa; 24% America; 14% Oceania; 10% Europe (306 k)
- 1961-1980: Africa 27%; America 24%; Asia 21%; Oceania 16%; Europe 13% (402 k)

@ramankuttyFarmingPlanetGeographic2008
- AIM: modelling global crop & pasture land cover
- For year 2000: 28 millions km2 pastures, compared to 34.4 millions FAO
- Europe (2000): 0.67 million km2 (14.4% cover land area)

@westLeveragePointsImproving2014
- AIM: how to improve global food security & environmental sustainability
- 1961-2009: percentage of calories from crop production consumed as food decreased from 57% to 51%
- Diet gap (human-edible crop calories which do not end up in food system): US 26%, China 17%, Western Europe 11%, Brazil 6% -> changing allocation in these regions would provide enough calories for 2.4 billion people

@cassidyRedefiningAgriculturalYields2013
- AIM: global patterns of crop production & allocation to determine amount of human-consumable calories globally produced
- Feed crop: 24% global crop production (mass), 36% global calorie production & 53% global plant protein production
- Among the 36% for animal feed, 89% is lost -> only 4% of crop-produced calories available to humans in the form of animal product
- To shift feed & other crop to direct human consumption would increase global calories by 70% or feed 4 billion people

@kastnerGlobalChangesDiets2012
- AIM: how changes in consumption drivers are projected to affect future global demand for cropland
- Steady global increase in average availability of food calories per person during recent decades -> rich diet food with higher rates of increase (including animal products), compared to more basic food with slower increase (cereals) or decrease (roots)
- In Northern Europe, total per capita food supply relatively constant.
- At global level, average land area needed to feed a person in 2005 was 2/3 of 1963 value -> food production more area-efficient
- Switch of category which accounts for the largest land use: from cereals (1963 40%; 2005 31%) to animal product (35%; 38%)
- Half of the 30% total cropland requirement increase between 1963 & 2005 is due to growing land demand for animal products
- Population growth as the major driver of growing land demand, but large heterogeneity according to regions (North vs South)

@zabelGlobalImpactsFuture2019
- AIM: to compare how scenarii of cropland expansion (+ 7.3 million km^2^) & intensification (yield gap closing on 10% - 1.5 million km^2^ - of land with highest intensification potential) would influence agricultural markets & biodiversity
- Both scenarii resulted in equal global production gains of 19% more crop yields compared with reference
- Agricultural markets
  - expansion mostly supported by South & Central America (+146%) & Australia & New Zealand (+78%), while EU turns from net-exporter to net-importer & Russia increases imports
  - intensification mostly supported by Sub-Saharan Africa (+78%), India (+68%) & former Soviet Union (+63%), with drop of crop prices
  - country contradicting trends depending on scenarii - i.e. South & Central America in top for crop expansion, but production would decrease in intensification scenario
- Agriculture-biodiversity hotspots
  - expansion pressure in Central & South America, Central Africa & Madagascar, South Africa, Eastern Australia, South-East Asia
  - intensification pressure overall less pronounced, particularly in Latin America, but still pressure in Sub-Saharan Africa, India, Nepal, Myanmar, China
  - intensification pressurise more cropland users compared with other specialists
  - consistent patterns for low agricultural potentials x low endemism richness (cold spots) for both scenarii
  - "hottest hotspots" whichever scenarii were Central & South America, Sub-Saharan Africa & Australia
- TAKE-HOME: 
  - both scenarii increased food production & lower prices but contradicting impacts in some regions depending on the strategy
  - targeted intensification on regions with lower biodiversity would seem more accurate than expanding croplands, but caution towards sustainable intensification
  
@haberlQuantifyingMappingHuman2007
- AIM: to assess global human appropriation of net primary production according to regions & land uses
- Humans appropriated about 24% of global terrestrial net primary production, among which 12.5% harvest, & about 29% of above-ground NPP, among which 20.4% harvest
- Total HANPP = 53% harvest + 40% land-use induced productivity changes + 7% fires
- HANPP cropping (83.5%) > infrastructure (73%) > grazing land (19.4%) > forestry (6.6%) -> agriculture accounts for 78% HANPP
- Potential (486<611) & harvest (41<296) NPP grazing < cropping, but actual (433>397) & remaining (392>101) NPP grazing > cropping
- HANPP countries: Southern Asia (63%) > Eastern & Southeastern Europe (52%) > Northern Africa & Western Asia (42%) > Western Europe (40%) > Eastern Asia (35%) > Southeastern Asia (30%) > Northern America (22%) > Sub-Saharan Africa (18%) > Latin America & Caribbean (16%) > Central Asia & Russian Federation (12%) > Oceania & Australia (11%)

@ewersIncreasesAgriculturalYield2009

@bommarcoExploitingEcosystemServices2018
- AIM: perspective on the role of ecosystem services in food security -> **still crop focused**
- Ecological intensification potential: reducing both yield gap (inherent productivity optimisation) & resource use efficiency gap (ouput/input optimisation)
- Underconsidered ecosystem services for food security: soil fertility, pest control, pollination by other pollinators than domestic bees
- Promoting ecosystem services
  - diversifying crop production
  - targeted diversification: e.g. push-pull combination with pest repellent intercropped in maize fields with pest attraction along the borders
- Interlinked targets
  - minimal environmental impact
  - increase resource use efficiency
  - flexibility & resilience (climate change, pest outbreaks)
  - adaptation to local conditions

@bommarcoEcologicalIntensificationHarnessing2013
- AIM: to review ecosystem services supporting or delivered by crop production & propose perspectives on ecological intensification -> **low relevance**
- Concept: safe space where global food demands met while environmental impacts minimised

@egliWinnersLosersNational2018
- AIM: explore spatial optimisation of sustainable intensification
- Same trends of agriculture intensification by 2040 would lead to a decrease of 11% of global biodiversity for a global production gain of 20%
- However, 60% of biodiversity loss projection would be avoided under national optimization scenario, and 88% would be avoided under global optimization scenario
- In global scenario production gains negatively correlated with national economic reliance on agriculture

@prettySustainableIntensificationAgricultural2014
- AIM: review on impact sustainable intensification in both developing & industrial countries
- "Foraging and farming systems across the world are 'overlapping, interdependent, contemporaneous, coequal and complementary' [@sponselFarmingForagingNecessary1989]"
- Agricultural intensification either
  - increasing yields per hectare
  - increasing cropping intensity per unit of land, input or livestock intensity
  - changing land use from low value crops or commodities to those that receive higher market prices or have better nutritional content
- "triple burden"
  - undernutrition = inadequate consumption of calories & proteins
  - malnutrition = inadequate consumption of other important nutrients
  - overnutrition = excessive consumption of calories
-> Future efforts to intensify agriculture should be targeted towards improving nutrition, as paradox of production increase along with burden depending on the region of the world
- "modern" agroecosystems -> high through-flow systems with external fossil fuel inputs & external harvest/leaking outputs
- transition to sustainability -> redirect to internal energy flows at least partially to support other ecosystem functions while avoiding loss of productivity
- Sustainable production systems -> "diverse, synergistic and tailored to their particular social-ecological contexts"
  - use crop varieties & livestock breeds with high ratio productivity to use of externally & internally derived inputs
  - avoid unnecessary use of external inputs
  - harness agro-ecological processes such as nutrient cycling, biological nitrogen fixation, allelopathy, predation & parasitism
  - minimise use of technologies or practices with adverse impacts on environment & human health
  - make productive use of human capital in the form of knowledge & capacity to adapt & innovate & of social capital to resolve common landscape-scale or system-wide problems
  - minimise impacts of system management on externalities (GHG, clean water...)
- Conventional vision of agricultural sustainability implies net reduction of inputs & intensity, though may not be fitted for all contexts -> "a better concept is one that centres on intensification of resources, making better use of existing resources & technologies" -> sustainable intensification
- "no clear conceptual, methodological or practical dividing line between ‘alternative’ and ‘conventional’ practice".
- Results from farm case study of economic success while positive impact on natural capital in the US:
  - all farms emphasized the importance of maintaining and building up natural resource base & maximising use of internal resources
  - all farmers emphasized values of environmental sustainability & importance of closed nutrient cycles
  - crop farms emphasized careful soil management, use of crop rotation & cover crop
  - livestock farms followed management practices not using hormones & antibiotics
  - more farmers participating in non-traditional commodity & direct sales markets
  - farms relied heavily on family members for labour & management
  - challenges & risks centered on rising land & rental values associated with urban development pressure, availability of water & spread of new weed species
-> food outputs increase by multiplicative (combination practices) & additive (diversification activities) ways
- Concrete practices: crop variety improvement; integrated pest management; management-intensive rotational grazing (MIRG) systems; conservation agriculture; agroforestry systems; patch intensification; system of rice intensification.
- Management-intensive rotational grazing systems -> greater temporal & spatial species diversity & improvement animal welfare over traditional (50-75 cattle) to large modern confinement systems (250 cattle)
- Perspectives for concrete implementations
  - both scientific & farmer input into technologies & practices which combine crops & animals with appropriate agroecological & agronomic management
  - creation of novel social infrastructure which both results in flows of information & builds trust amongst individuals & agencies
  - improvement of farmer knowledge & capacity through the use of farmer field schools & communication technologies
  - engagement with private sector to supply goods & services, & development of farmers capacity to add value through their own business development
  - focus on women's educational, microfinance & agricultural technology needs
  - ensuring that microfinance & rural banking is available to farmers' groups
  - ensure public sector support to lever up necessary public goods -> innovative & capable research systems, dense social infrastructure, appropriate economic incentives, legal status for land ownership, improved access to markets
  
@milderAssessmentMultifunctionalityAgroecological2012
- AIM: to review agroecological intensification approaches (conservation agriculture, holistic grazing management, organic agriculture, precision agriculture, system of rice intensification) & their impact on ecosystem services
- Nature gap = "the deficit in the provision of ecosystem services and other conservation values between any given farming system and a system in the same environment and with the same level of agricultural outputs that is optimally managed for ecosystem co-benefits"
- All systems encourage farmer decision-making in response to monitoring of system conditions & responses -> no strictly followed rules, much open to interpretation -> extend heterogeneity & variability
- Ecosystem services x yield
  - conservation agriculture & holistic grazing management -> mainly improvement of ecosystem service provision, but contradicting regarding yield
  - organic agriculture -> no main trend, but no record of yield decrease with ecosystem services increase
  - precision agriculture -> almost always increase yield, never decrease yield & ecosystem services, but mostly neutral than gain in ecosystem services
  - system rice intensification -> mainly win-win
- Data availability issue: except for certified organic farming, very hard to evaluate the extent of adoption of these practices, and thus to assess their effect
- "At present there is not an adequate empirical basis to develop quantitative estimates of the aggregate contribution of AEI to food production or specific ecosystem benefits at a global scale."
- TAKE-HOME: research gap between, on one hand, farm-scale research investigating local effects of AEI but with poor appreciation of aggregate effects or scalability, and on the other hand global research assessing aggregate targets & alternative pathways to meet them but with little consideration of role of AEI

@rockstromSustainableIntensificationAgriculture2017
- AIM: to propose a paradigm for sustainable intensification to be defined & translated into operational framework for agricultural development
- Objective: to shift from paradigm with productivity first & sustainability as a cover up for reduction environmental impacts, to paradigm where sustainability makes the core strategy for agricultural development
- Sustainable intensification according to proposed paradigm: hunger reduction through biodiversity conservation that secures ecological functions in agricultural landscapes -> use of both land-sparing & land-sharing approaches across local & regional scales
-> new definition of sustainable intensification from socio-ecological criteria = "adopting practices along the entire value chain of the global food system that meet rising needs for nutritious and healthy food through practices that build socio-ecological resilience and enhance natural capital within the safe operating space of the Earth system."
- long-term SIA is not only about local farm productivity through practices but equally consider safeguarding ecological functions across scale and enhancing resilience against rising frequency &/or intensity of shocks and stresses from global changes
-> "strategic land-use planning to maintain and improve interacting stocks & flows [...] across landscape mosaics [...] so that multi-functionality of the whole landscape is manageable across scales."
- three-step approach
  - 1. as resource efficient as possible by combining locally relevant breeds & crops with/without genetic improvement with minimum inputs & close nutrient, carbon & water cycles
  - 2. landscape-scale resilience by sustaining ecosystem functions & services
  - 3. connect thinking, planning & practice across scales to apprehend ecological interactions in Anthropocene
- TAKE-HOME: 
  - livelihood-centered paradigm for sustainable intensification entails trans-disciplinarity & solution-oriented knowledge generation combining academic & practical knowledge through co-design & co-development of research
  - "grand experiments" with transdisciplinary collaboration to pilot sustainable intensification at regional/basin scale, as large R&D investments, to pool experience, explore synergies and trade-offs


## GLOBAL LIVESTOCK TRENDS

@piipponenGlobalTrendsGrassland2022
- AIM: to estimate the global trends of livestock carrying capacity over 2001-2015 period
- Median AGB & CC: Norway overall amongst lowest range (<5 animal unit/km^2^/y)
- Global trends CC: NS (58% total area) > negative (27%) > positive (15%) -> most drastic decrease in Europe
- Stocking density -> regionally medium (20%-65%)-overstocked (>65%) compared with carrying capacity, but not always visible when flattened on the whole country area
- TAKE-HOME:
  - 27% global grassland area with declining carrying capacity, mostly concentrated in Europe
  - high stocking density in Western Norway compared with carrying capacity

@fetzelSeasonalityConstraintsLivestock2017
- AIM: to globally estimate the limiting effect of seasonality on grazing intensity in natural grasslands
- Global observed grazing intensity of total area (GIobs)
  - <15% on 79% of total area: <2% on 36%; <5% on 56%; <10% on 71%
  - high prevailing in arid & semi-arid regions where can >50%
- Grazing intensity limited by seasonality (GIseason)
  - >10% on ~33% & >15% on 23% all grazing lands
  - >10% prevailing in Latin America & Sub-Saharan Africa, where GIobs often <2%
- Difference GIobs & GIseason
  - GIobs > GIseason ~61% total global natural grassland: East & Southeastern Europe, Northern Africa, Western Asia, Southern Asia -> increase socio-economic costs for other feeding sources
  - GIseason > GIobs ~39% total global natural grassland: South-Eastern Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America -> potential for increasing production

@alkemadeAssessingImpactsLivestock2013
- AIM: meta-analysis on mean species abundance of native rangeland species assemblage & 2000-2050 scenario regarding food demand & livestock production
- baseline projection (International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science & Technology for Development)
  - man-made rangelands: increase until 2030 & decrease until 2050 -> +1% net increase (+ 0.2 million km^2^) to 2050
  - natural rangelands: decline 3 millions km^2^ (25 to 22) to 2050
- high techno/science/knowledge variant -> (+) agri productivity
  - decrease man-made & increase natural rangelands, particularly in Africa (-50% man-made)
- literature review MSA according to different rangeland stages:
  natural (ref, 1) > ungrazed/abandoned (0.7) > moderately used (0.6) intensively used (0.5) > man-made (0.3)
- GLOBIO model with MSA values
  - decline MSA continuously till 2050, with increase grazing pressure for all regions except Central & South America in base scenario
  - with high techno scenario, decrease grazing pressure in half regions (C-S America, Europe, South Asia), but great increase in Africa

@steinfeldLivestockProductionGlobal2010
- AIM: commentary on global impact of livestock production & explore solutions to limit these impacts in the future
- Take-home: there are opportunities for limiting livestock ecological impact, by "responsible" intensification (increased efficiency in regards to the use of natural resources and methane emissions), change and convergence of diets and targeted policies on both production and consumption ends

@wirseniusHowMuchLand2010
- AIM: to propose model-based scenarii of global agricultural land use in 2030 to investigate potential for limitate land use - complement of the FAO 2030 projection which did not include yields related to pastures & livestock feed
- Most common advanced option to close the yield gap is the intensification of already existing agricultural lands, but this strategy is limited both by the environmental impact and by closing of genetic gap.
- Scenarii explored:
  - increase efficiency of food chain (from "field-to-work")
  - change diets towards food commodities consuming less land
  - increasing yields & nutritive quality of permanent pastures which globally account to 3.5 billion ha
- For all scenari, global area covered by permanent grassland decreases, while it was projected to increase under FAO scenario.
  - Europe particularly impacted
      - 1997/1999 - 182 million hectares
      - FAO reference - 109 million hectares
      - increased livestock productivity - 108 million hectares
      - ruminant meat substitution - 84 million hectares
      - limitation food waste & diet change - 73 million hectares
  -> intensification livestock production
- Conclusions very "technocratic" like - make it more productive, replace ~20% ruminant by pig & poultry (like if pig & poultry does not have environmental impact?)

@naylorLosingLinksLivestock2005
- AIM: commentary on environmental issues related to the industrial livestock sector
- Disconnection from the "base" -> production increase of external feeds with high environmental impacts
  - Impact in the feed production (e.g. soybean in Brazil)
  - Impact with the industrial farming (e.g. poultry in China)
- increase of meat consumption in developing countries
- if the whole world was the follow Westerners diet, there would be the need for 2/3 more agricultural land (2.5 billions ha)
- Take-home: need ro recouple crop and livestock systems, if not physically at least by regulation and/or market to control negative environmental externalities
- Very economy focused, does not put in question at all globalisation -> "In a global economy with no global society, it may well be up to consumers to set a sustainable course" TRES REDUCTEUR

@omaraRoleGrasslandsFood2012
- AIM: review on how grasslands contributes to global food supply and climate mitigation
- Global state of grasslands not very good, due to the abandonment of traditional transhumance practices in favour to more intensive, continuous and extended farming
- from FAO (2009), trends over the last 50 years, but since 1991 quite static
  - 9.6% increase of the world's agricultural area
  - 9.6% increase of arable lands and permanent crops
  - 8.7% increase permanent meadows and pastures
- less carbon emission in EU countries where livestock is mostly fed with grass (ref to the cirad report Leip2010)
- Grasslands in warmer regions will be likely to be impacted by climate change
- Take-home: perspectives for grasslands to not only feed growing populations (ruminants efficient converters of forages & poor-quality feeds into humanly edible energy & proteins) but also act as a carbon storage, but which will be geographically variable according to climate change trend (less productive in South, more productive in North)

## AGRICULTURE IN EUROPE

@jeanneretIncreaseFoodProduction2021
- AIM: how semi-natural habitat conversion to crops would influence diversity & productivity in Europe
- Productivity not related with share of semi-natural habitats in 10 European countries, including NO.
- Question the objective of +10% food production increase by FAO -> not even possible for some countries even if total conversion into arable land (Germany, Italy, Austria).
- Importance of semi-natural habitats to biodiversity of agricultural landscape & increase of conversion would sacrifice lots of it for only a limited gain in production.

@stoateEcologicalImpactsEarly2009
- AIM: literature review on the ecological impacts of agricultural change since 2000 in EU (EU focused so limited relevance)

## FOOD SECURITY & LOCAL FOOD SYSTEMS

Conventional and traditional agricultures rely on fundamentally different approaches of natural resources management [@bignalLowIntensityFarmingSystems1996; @vosTrendsEuropeanCultural1999]. Conventional farming is driven by objectives of performance and efficiency on the short-term. It aims to maximise the production by overcoming environmental constraints through the use of machinery and agrochemistry, resulting in homogenisation of landscapes and practices [@jongmanHomogenisationFragmentationEuropean2002]. On the other hand, traditional small-scale farming has developed to adapt to the local environment, with diversified practices and limitation of inputs. This strategy prioritises long term preservation of the natural capital over immediate production and enhances both the heterogeneity and the resilience of the agroecosystem [@gardnerAgriculturalResiliencePerspectives2019; @menconiRevisitingGlobalFood2022].

@gliessmanAgroecologyAgroecosystems2004

@holt-gimenezAgroecologyFoodSovereignty2012
- AIM: to point out flaws of the neoliberal/corporative agriculture and explore alternatives of peasant/small-scale farming systems (big political emphasis, engaged)
- smallholders both a mean and barrier to expansion of capitalist agriculture
  - mean: smallholders subsidies with cheap labor & factor market
  - barrier: diversified farming & knowledge systems, smallholder's pluriactive livelihood help to preserve peasant systems
- TAKE-HOME: crisis will not be solved by what created the problem, recentralising food systems to self-sufficient smallholdings is critical

@cunninghamCloseYieldgapSaving2013
- AIM: review of local-based solutions to address food demand challenge
- Off-site & broad scale effect of intensive farming
  - pesticides and chemical spillover, nutrient leaking
  - environmental cost of input production -> shift from pasture-based to grain-fed animals (e.g. New Zealand) -> "exported" intensification & environmental damages
- Externalising targets
  - Relationship between land use intensity and biodiversity loss not always straightforward - some productive land use can also support relatively high biodiversity
  - impact should not be only assessed by area, but through the whole production system
- Adapt to landscape
  - Biodiversity value and production potential vary across the globe
  - Different land use history also affect potential outcomes
    - heavily transformed land (e.g. cereal plain in Australia) will be hard to change
    - agroforestry with cacao and coffee which ressemble native habitats
  - Trade-offs depend on the type of agro-ecological systems -> no global magical solution
- Smallholdings: intensification would be harmful not only for biodiversity but also for local population
- TAKE-HOME: 
  - strategy to close the yield gaps should be rooted within people's cultural values and be adapted to local environment and historical land use
  - "techniques for improved yield are only appropriate if they can be implemented in the smallholder context and avoid homogenisation of the diverse landscape"

@menconiRevisitingGlobalFood2022
- AIM: use Food Self-Sufficiency Index to assess food system resilience at local scale for different communities
- Index created from ecological footprint (consumption of a community) and biocapacity indices (production potential of an area) -> ecological balance between production and consumption in an area
- 4 steps
  - Community - evaluation of food demand of the local community
  - Land - calculation of agro-climatic maps of the study area
  - Crops - evaluation of crop suitability
  - FSSI - evaluation of the percentage of achievable food self-sufficiency in study area
- TAKE-HOME:
  - involving local community, participatory approach
  - increasing agrobiodiversity & heterogeneity to improve resilience in changing environment

@herreroSmartInvestmentsSustainable2010
- AIM: perspective to revolve future investments in food security towards smallholders and mixed crop-livestock systems
- Focus on Southern hemisphere and mixed crop-livestock more than "smallholdings" in general
- TAKE-HOME: "to reduce poverty while increasing food supplies and maintaining functional ecosystems will require well-regulated and differential growth in crop and livestock production"

@douwevanderploegPeasantriesTwentyfirstCentury2010
- AIM: to comment and investigate the trend of peasantry re-emergence and discuss continuities and disruptions between old and modern peasantry
- Drawback of the current conventional system: not only it excluded farmers from the get go, but in the end it also destroys farmers who decided to follow the trend and convert themselves
- Evolution of peasantry through time with a good share of transformation -> high adaptability capacity, can take very diverse forms
- From land to ecological capital
  - Conventional: Transformation farming into conversion of commodities, maybe from somewhere else, to other commodities, which can go somewhere else
  - "The more farming is grounded on ecological capital, the lower the monetary coasts of production will be"
  - Continuity but disruption in the way that now it is a conscious choice, while before it was self-evident, no other way to go
  - Centrality of ecological capital both requires and contributes to relative autonomy which develops local network and knowledge
- From subsistence to self-provisioning
  - self-provisioning refers to the necessary resources to the unit of production, while subsistence refers to the unit of consumption
  - self-provisioning sustains autonomy while enlargement tighten dependency within production processes
  - renewal of pluriactivity amongst European farmers, through multifunctionality which also relies on non-agricultural activities
- From partial integration to actively constructed distantiation
**to continue**

# AGRICULTURE, BIODIVERSITY, HABITAT

## CHARACTERISATION AGRICULTURE

@sumbergWhatConventionalAgriculture2022
- AIM: to discuss the meaning and use of the adjective "conventional" when characterising agriculture
- three observed uses of the word "conventional"
  - in experiment/analytical context, as reference or control against alternative practices
  - in conceptualisation of alternative agricultural practices, with inherent assumptions (destructive, mechanised, large-scale, controlled by corporations...)
  - in promotion of new forms of agriculture in the modern sense, in that case conventional will be old-fashioned and conservative
- evolution of meaning through time
  - 50s-60s - reference to everyday agriculture, ordinary, common place
  - 70s-80s - increased use to characterise practices to be compared to organic farming
  - afterwards, increasing use of conventional as opposed to specific alternative systems without proper definition
- "The recognition of the need for local adaptation is both important and pragmatic, but it complicates any attempt to investigate the performance or potential advantages of these alternatives"
- Take-home message: not denying current challenges for agriculture or the need for characterising farming practices, but warning to use inconsiderately the dichotomy conventional-alternative (parallel with modern-traditional), while the reality is a complex gradient that depends on local environmental conditions, historical management...
- MISSING POINT ACCORDING TO ME - how about education? At least at the national scale (and I argue now transnational, with globalisation and international market), there are norms, practices promoted by institutions and organisms who trained the future farmers, and also agriculture lobbies (in opposite with the 'old days' where it was direct knowledge transmission from expert).

## AGRICULTURE & BIODIVERSITY

@seppeltHarmonizingBiodiversityConservation2016

@chappellFoodSecurityBiodiversity2011
- AIM: literature review on relationships between food insecurity & biodiversity loss, with an emphasis on comparing agricultural methods
- Conventional vs alternative
  - Conventional practices
    - industrial model of increased production centralisation/consolidation
    - functional separation
    - claims of economic efficiency
    - attempts to control & manage nature as commodity
  - Alternative
    - holistic & multifunctional system integrating natural ecological processes
    - high levels of recycling
    - fundamental interconnections between agriculture, human culture & larger social issues in the rest of the food system
    - proposed definition relies on intention rather than methodology = "range of management and technological options used to reduce costs, protect health & the environment, & enhance biological interactions & natural processes" from the US National Research Council
- Alternative systems shown to be more energy efficient than conventional systems
- Counter-argument against land sparing: no clear evidence that more land is necessary to produce sufficient yields to adequately feed the world
- "There is evidence to support the proposition that alternative agricultural methods can provide enough food, on the global scale, to provide a comparable level of food security as would conventional agriculture"
- Alternative more based on synergy biodiversity/production vs conventional trade-off
- "The obvious alternative to complete global redistribution of food is to enhance self-sufficiency on a regional & sub-regional basis"
- Food security framework Rocha's Five A's:
  - Availability refers to the sufficiency of a food supply to meet people's need
  - Accessibility refers to people's economic & physical ability to acquire food
  - Acceptability addresses the cultural and nutritional suitability of the available food
  - Appropriateness evaluates the ecological sustainability & the safety of a food supply
  - Agency is the "right to knowledge and knowledge of rights"
  -> up to now disproportionate efforts towards availability while not much on the rest

@altieriEcologicalRoleBiodiversity1999
- AIM: review the effect of biodiversity in securing crop protection & soil fertility
- Genetic vulnerability of current crop system
- Characterisation traditional agroecosystems
  - promotion diversity of diet and income
  - stability of production
  - minimisation of risk
  - reduced insect & disease incidence
  - efficient use of labor
  - intensification of production with limited resources
  - maximisation of returns under low levels of technology
- traditional multiple cropping system estimated to provide ~15-20% world food supply
- Traditional systems mimic natural processes, thus inherently sustainable -> models of efficiency which are important to study for understanding mechanisms
- Different categories of biodiversity according to its role in the agroecosystem [@swiftBiodiversityAgroecosystemFunction1996] + planned vs associated biodiv (Vandermeer & Perfecto 1995 - not access)
- Importance to identify desirable biodiversity not only for direct functions (e.g. pest control) but also indirect function (e.g. nutrient & water cycling) -> complementarity & synergisms from mixed crop-livestock systems & agroforestry

@swiftBiodiversityAgroecosystemFunction1996
- AIM: to describe ecological functions linked to biodiversity in agricultural systems (NOT FULL ACCESS, interpretation from @altieriEcologicalRoleBiodiversity1999)
- Three categories of biodiversity
  - productive biota, which is chosen by the farmer and play a determining role in diversity & complexity of agroecosystem
  - resource biota, which contributes to productivity through pollination, biological control...
  - destructive biota, which alters productivity and that farmers aim at reducing through cultural management

@middletonRediscoveringTraditionalVegetation2013
- AIM: review how the loss of human induced management/disturbance in preserves affects biodiversity
- Importance of disturbance to maintain habitat heterogeneity + seed dispersal by livestock which used to be bigger (transhumance)
- Take-home: conservation focused towards preserved areas (so not so directly linked to cultural landscapes), but basically reintroducing cattle/bison grazing along with fire within these preserved areas which were cut from any form of disturbance could enhance biodiversity, at the condition to have control of the disturbance and to adapt if habitats are particularly sensitive

@asnerGrazingSystemsEcosystem2004
- AIM: review on the major processes related to grazing at global scale & assess environmental footprint
- Soil: in boreal biomes, grazing preferentially takes place on alfisols & spodosols
- Woody encroachment as one of the big three global syndromes of grazing

## AGRICULTURE INTENSIFICATION & CHANGES

@grauLandSparingLand2013

@billenReshapingEuropeanAgrofood2021
- AIM: perspective on how to reduce by half nitrogen losses in Europe while keeping food production & feed import levels
- Past trends 1961-2013: increase population (428 to 540 millions) + protein consumption (4.9 to 5.7 kgN/cap/y) + share animal proteins but fish (35% to 55%) while decrease agricultural land
- Characteristics European agro-food system
  - heavily dependent on synthetic N fertiliser inputs
  - large burden of livestock metabolism in overall agricultural N cycle with consumption 75% European crop protein production + 2.7 million TgN/y in imported feed
  - Norway: particularly high fraction of imported feed in livestock nutrition (40-60%) compared with European average (19%)
- N losses 1961-2015: from 9.5 to 11.3 TgN/y
- Agro-ecological scenario based on 3 levers
  (1) changing diet + human excreta recycling: 5 kgN/cap/y made of 45% cereal + 15% fresh fruit & vegetables + 10% grain legumes + 30% animal
  (2) agro-ecological practices avoiding N fertiliser: no change in land cover but implementation crop rotation alternating vegetables, cereals & grain legumes
  (3) reconnecting livestock farming to cropping systems -> back to infield-outfield strategy, making livestock density as only lever of intensification through manure application

@foleyGlobalConsequencesLand2005
- AIM: review on global environmental consequences of land use changes
- "Modern land use practices, while increasing the short-term supplies of material goods, may undermine many ecosystem services in the long run, even on regional and global scales"
- Confronting the problem:
  - trade-offs between short-term needs and sustain quality of goods and services on the long-term
  - assess resilience of human-nature systems
  - cross-scale and trans-nations policy and decision-making
- TAKE-HOME: cross-disciplinary research + increase collaboration between scientists and practitioners

@flynnLossFunctionalDiversity2009
- AIM: meta-analysis on the impact of agricultural intensification on functional diversity on different temperate & tropical environments
- 4 scenarii
  - Low functional redundancy - FD decline due to species decline
  - High functional redundancy - FD stable despite decline of species
  - Functionally redundant species lost first - FD decline more slowly than richness, system becomes low redundancy
  - Functionally unique species lost first - FD declines faster than richness, system greatly affected even if only a few species lost
- FD & richness trends
  - both FD & richness of mammals & birds decreased with intensification
  - no pattern for plants
- Expected FD pattern compared to a random assemblage from local species pool
  - for birds & mammals, agricultural and semi-natural landscapes more likely to have lower than expected FD compared with natural landscapes
  - overall studies, natural landscapes more likely to have higher than expected FD
  - no strong trends for plants
- patterns of lost functional traits under intensification
  - birds: body size, food type & foraging habitat - large predators more affected
  - mammals: agricultural areas lacked species with small litter size & some specialists (fish, fruit, seed, nuts)
  - plants: height most important trait (large plants affected)

@beckmannConventionalLandUse2019
- AIM: meta-analysis on the effect intensification on both productivity and species richness for different land uses (forestry, crops, green fodder)
![From Beckmann et al. (2019) - Land use intensity classes](illustrations/Beckmann.etal2019_IntensityTable.png)
- All land use types (forestry, crops, green fodder) considered, intensification within low-intensity systems would not affect yield and species richness (all taxa), but stepping up to medium intensity would expose to species richness loss (-7.7% [-13.7, -1.3]) without substantial yield increase (+6% [-5, +18.3])
- Still all land use types considered: the most impactful intensification was within medium-intensity systems for both yield increase (+84.9% [+65.8, +106.1]) and species richness loss (-22.9% [-28.1, -17.4]) -> but careful, low replication level for meta-analysis (19 & 29 respectively)
- In general for green fodder systems, species richness significantly decrease under intensification (-12.4% [-21.8, -1.9]) & yield increased but not significantly (+14.2 [-5.6, +38.2]). Invertebrates particularly impacted in green fodder compared with other land uses
- land use history, taxonomic group and climatic zone covariates explained significant proportion of heterogeneity

@newboldGlobalEffectsLand2015
- AIM: global study on impact of anthropogenic land use change on biodiversity & projection until 2095
- Estimated loss of 13.6% of terrestrial within-sample species richness from past land use change
- Worst scenario 2100: reduction 77% within-sample species richness

@kleijnRelationshipFarmlandBiodiversity2009
- AIM: to assess plant species richness across nitrogen (intensity) gradient across grasslands & croplands in Europe & to evaluate conservation costs/benefits
- N inputs significantly negatively affected plant species richness, rare & subdominant species
- Best model fit between N inputs and species richness is exponential for both grasslands & crops
- Best model fit for subdominant grassland & arable plants is linear with N and critical exponential with species richness
- Interpretation: effect of land use changes more important in species-rich extensively managed agricultural areas, while not much in species-poor intensively managed areas

@bentonFarmlandBiodiversityHabitat2003

## NORWEGIAN AGRICULTURE

@asheimPolicyMeasuresPreserve2020
- AIM: to model scenario of agricultural policies/practices on Norwegian small-scale sheep & mixed dairy systems
- Already existing subsidies: 
  - Area and cultural landscape support (ACL): non-targeted, only few disapproved practices (e.g. removal pond, stone fences, pesticides on edges...) leading to reduced support -> overall criticised for lack of characterisation of the environmental criteria
  - Husbandry animal support scheme (HAS): no environmental criteria
  - Grazing animal scheme (GS): either support for grazing animal or grazing on outfield area (not both)
  - Regional environmental support (RES) schemes: Special measures in the agricultural landscape (STILK, 1990s) & Specific environmental measures in agriculture (SMIL, 2004) that support grazing on steep slopes
- Farm model: differs according to livestock, with usually mixed dairy-beef systems on full-time larger farms while sheep grazing on part-time, smaller farm

@fabianGEMASSpatialDistribution2014
- AIM: to map & characterise the spatial distribution of agricultural & grazing land pH in Europe
- Norway with the lowest average pH compared with other European countries
- Factors favouring soil acidity in Scandinavia: predominance acid crystalline rocks & absence carbonate rocks + cold climate

@hamrePlantSpeciesRichness2010
- AIM: to compare the distribution of semi-natural grassland species in a W-Norway landscape between 2002 & 1865
- Patch types: ploughed vegetables, ploughed grass, ploughed grass + grazing, orchard, horticulture, ploughed fallow, semi-natural, midfield islet, woodland, margins (divided in sub-categories)
- Explanatory variables: patch spatial characteristics, canopy structure, long-term management intensity, temporal continuity
- Species composition
  - Axis 1: (-) long-term management intensity & production capacity 1865 vs (+) canopy height -> gradient intensively managed land to semi-natural & woodlands
  - Axis 2: (-) wire fence vs (+) agricultural use -> gradient boundary to open land used for agriculture
- Habitat specificity
  - (+)* correlated with gamma diversity contribution of individual patches, with highest for semi-natural and lowest for ploughed lands
  - (+)* predictors: canopy height & continuity
- Semi-natural affiliation: 
  - (+)* correlated with habitat specificity & gamma diversity
  - (-)* predictors: long-term management intensity & production capacity 1865
- TAKE-HOME:
  - persistence typical semi-natural grassland species after end of activity -> extinction debt
  - correlation patches with high richness typical semi-natural grassland species, remnant semi-natural grassland patches & man-made structure with long continuity -> restoration former grassland favour both ecological and cultural values

@prosch-danielsenPalaeoecologicalInvestigationsReconstruction2000
- AIM: palynology analysis to determine the period of first forest clearances by humans & subsequent development of heathlands in Western Norway
- Deforestation process lasted for at least 3600y (4000-400 BC) with 3 pronounced clearance periods: Mesolithic/Early Neolithic transition (4000-3600 BC), Middle Neolithic II/Early Late Neolithic transition (2500-2200 BC) & Late Neolithic to Bronze Age period II (1900-1400 BC)
- Heathland expansion took place for a period of about 4000y (4000-200 BC)

@hetlandPluriactivityStrategyEmployment1986
- AIM: characterise pluriactivity as Norwegian farmer lifestyle and its evolution
- Pluriactivity as "traditional employment adaptation in rural Norway" which shifted from "fishermen farmers" to "white collar farmers" -> at first politics thought this traditional way of living was obsolete and would disappear with modernity, but more recently they changed their minds and are rather thinking of how to stimulate this pluriactivity
- Def pluriactivity = "the diversification of activities carried out by one household on and off the holding in order to secure the household's economy and welfare."
- Evolution
  - before WWII - nearly all farmers pluriactive, including fishing & forestry
  - after WWII - incentives towards "family farms" (without activity off the farm), supported by agricultural policies, but still 2/3 farms pluriactive -> particularly true for our study area with ~75% pluriactive farms
  - However pluriactive farms do not decline more rapidly than family farms, as latter drop from 39% in 1949 to 31% in 1979
- Typology of various forms of pluriactivity & trends 1969-1979
  - *Family* farms without activity outside the farm, but which include forestry, fur farming & farm tourism as long as it is on the same holding -> slight decrease from 33% to 31%
  - *Traditional division* of labour when husband works off the farm and wife at home, responsible of farm work when alone -> strong decrease from 37% to 26%
  - *Complex division* of labour when both spouses employed off the farm & both share in farm work -> strong increase from 4% to 15%
  - *Modern division* of labour when wife works off the farm & husband at home with farm responsibility -> slight increase from 1% to 3%
  - *Single* farmers working both on and off the farm -> relatively stable from 7% to 8%
  - Farmers with *pension* -> stable from 17% to 17%
- Policy support towards pluriactivity to tackle overproduction, unemployment & marginal areas depletion
  - 57% percent all farms provide less than one annual work unit -> defined as pluriactive by the State Bank of Agriculture
  - in 1980, only 6.3% of the farms which received subsidies for loans & grant-in-aid were pluriactive
- Change of pluriactive model during investment phase
  - traditional from 63% to 36%
  - complex from 29% to 10%
  - modern from 9% to 26%
  - family from - to 28%
- Historical evolution of pluriactivity over 3 overlapping periods
  - *subsistence economy* - main motive to secure household's economy & welfare
  - *commercialization and specialization* - specialization risks reduced by technology & welfare payments, & many farmers work off the farm to secure investments in farming
  - *social foothold* - focus on social values connected to farms. Many farmers with full-time work off the farm, & investments not towards farm activity but rather property & place to live
-> from agriculture as central to decide which activities were possible off the farm to the other way around

@jonesLandtenureLandscapeChange1988
- AIM: to characterise changes of holdings and landscape in fishing communities on outer coast of Central Norway from 1880 to the present
- Fisher-farmer livelihood cultural landscape - "small farm with modest dwelling-house and simple outhouse for animals, small plot of cultivated land for potatoes and hay, boathouse down by the shore & fishing boat periodically anchored offshore"
- Processes of change from end of 19th century
  - Dissolution of large proprietary system: transition to owner-occupancy from 1875 to 1950 & collapse of proprietors' local trading monopolies
  - Industrialisation & rationalisation of primary occupations, with evolution of fishing industry at the same time as agricultural transformation -> "transition from many-sided, labour-intensive and household-oriented production to a specialised, capital-intensive & market-oriented production"
- Traditional landscape in replacement by other landscapes:
  - landscapes of depopulation
  - landscapes of recreation
  - specialized fishing landscapes
  - urban landscapes
  - conservation landscapes

@dramstadTenancyNorwegianAgriculture2010
- AIM: to analyse trends of agricultural tenancy in Norway from 1999 to 2003
- Average farm size in 1949 ~4.8 ha
- Issues to explore:
  - the extent of tenancy in different regions and how this changes
  - trends in the number of tenancies farmers manage
  - whether tenancy acts as an alternative to abandonment
  - whether landscapes of particular cultural, tourist or ecological significance are being extensively managed via tenancy
- Changes in agriculture from 1999 to 2003
  - number farmers: from 70,740 to 58,231 -> ~18% decline
  - total agricultural area: from 1,038,246 ha to 1,040,385 ha -> ~2000 ha increase
  - average farm size: from 14.7 ha to 17.9 ha -> ~18% increase, smallest change in Hordaland
  - decrease (-45%) in the amount of area managed by smaller farms (<5 ha)
  - increase (+50%) in the amount of area managed by larger farms (>50 ha)
- Occurrence of tenancy
  - from 53.9% to 58.3% farmers who applied for subsidies who rented at least partially -> +7.5%
  - from 46.1% to 38.2% farmers who only manage the land they own -> -17%
  -> decline of traditional owner occupancy as management method in Norway
  - increase of average number of tenancies, maximum number of tenancies per farmer & average area of rented land per farmer -> increase complexity of management arrangements
  - decrease of owner-occupier across all Norway -> more drastic for municipalities which had originally high number and almost negligible for municipalities with the lowest 1999 number (-> sort of low plateau?)
  - areas in orange in 1999 (20-35% OO) likely to have moved to red (0-20% OO)
  - Western Norway (our study area) relatively preserved compared to the rest of the country
  - Most municipalities in Nordhordland with ~50% of tenancy, but with generally low number of tenancies per farmer. Overall areas with most tenancies on the coast, as well as Modalen
- Take-home: 
  - tenancy common & widely used in Norway. represents a large proportion of total agricultural area
  - farmer "survival" strategies
    - quite farming & rent land
    - growth farm business & acquisition additional land mainly through tenancy arrangements
    - manage own land & secure survival through additional income

@daugstadAgricultureUpholderCultural2006
- AIM: exploring interactions between agriculture and cultural heritage in Norway by analyzing explicit and implicit value appreciations
- dilemma as agriculture both a threat & a caretaker of cultural heritage depending on the practices & the environment
- knowledge linking agriculture & cultural heritage mainly related to the multifunctionality concept, either from external perspective (e.g. tourism) or from internal perspective (e.g. farmers)
  - outsiders will be attached to the aesthetics of the old traditional landscape
  - insiders will tend towards productivity and "active" management
- Main concepts explored come from:
  - "Commodification" of cultural heritage = "extension of the commodity form to goods and services that were not previously commodified" (e.g. tourism industry developed around agriculture)
  - authenticity, which can be defined as "being actually and precisely what is claimed", thus opposed to commodification
- chosen concepts: cultural heritage, active agriculture, added value
  - Cultural heritage - individual locality to which there is a historical or prehistoric dimension, event, belief or tradition, with cultural environment being larger contexts of cultural heritage sties representing time-depth or functional relations in the landscape [ref to Miljøverndepartementet]
  - Active farming in relation with cultural heritage (positive/negative) - no clear or obvious difference between active & passive farming
  - Added value in relation to the contribution cultural heritage provide to human, whether monetary or not
- Cultural landscape in Nordic context
  - term has been used as synonymously for agriculturally influenced landscape, especially for traditional/historical agriculture when coming from the Ministry of Environment
  - Ministry Environment, Directorate Cultural Heritage, Directorate Nature Management - cultural heritage sites & environments as expressions of our common memory that communicate knowledge about human life, activity and capacity through time -> help understand relationship between past & present, nature & man, and different cultures
  - Documents from agricultural sector - concept only recently used, focusing on areas of agricultural use associating the practice, the buildings & other cultural elements
  - Norwegian farmers' union - states as major aim to "secure agriculture and maintain rural areas' economic, social and cultural interests".
  - OECD relates to multifunctional as the fact that agriculture may be shaping the landscape & creating environmental goods & contributing to socio-economic sustainability in rural areas
- Active agriculture & cultural heritage
  - Directorate for cultural heritage - "If the dominant cultural heritage values are to be maintained, this requires a sustainable agriculture capable of running, managing, & maintaining values. At the same time this practice must not destroy or diminish the cultural heritage values." -> protection through use
  - Agricultural sector - "living" agriculture as argument for agriculture based on food & fibre production
  - Norwegian farmers' union - farmer as supporter of cultural values
  - Norwegian Smallholders' association - more focus on social degradation of rural areas - no mention of cultural heritage per se, but positive effects on settlement, employment & cultural landscapes as arguments towards small-scale farming
- Added value
  - From environmental sector - cultural heritage as a resource to be used, especially for local communities not only for economic value but also for knowledge, historical insight & sustainable development
  - From agricultural sector - economic potential of cultural heritage seen to add legitimacy for economic sector & lifestyle
- Changing perspectives & policies: change in agricultural policies towards farmer as independent entrepreneur in post-productivist context -> diversification of agriculture in activities beyond conventional farming

@forbordDriversChangeNorwegian2014
- AIM: to investigate what have been the changes of farmland control in Norway for the past 50 years
- Collapse of agricultural holdings [statNorwaySSB], from ~200,000 in 1959 to ~50,000 50 years after, while number of properties stable -> increase size of working farms & shift from owner occupation to renting
- post-WWII social contract emphasized productivity, self-sufficiency, efficiency & maintaining farmer income ~ urban worker
- notion of "ownership" in agricultural land management - "land tenure governs the relationship between people and the environment by setting restrictions and rights on physical interaction and consequently defining permissible cultural engagement"
- prior to 1900s, ownership/rental relationship heavily in favour of land owner, but in recent decades return of land leasing but with more complex network of stakeholders
- Comparative areas: Eastern Norway (cereal), Central-West (intensive livestock), Western Norway (extensive livestock, with fruit/berry production)
- Agricultural policy & legal & economic instruments
  - legal vs economic: direct impact of legal with transfer of land rights through state, while economic influences production by defining desirable land use options
  - policy encouraging deregulation & market-oriented decisions started in the 1990s, with cut of subsidies for grain (became cheaper food for livestock), subsequent increase of maximum legal size of animal production systems
  - Concession Act - obligation of residency on property 5 years after take-over & regulation purchase by legal persons
- Change in farmland control in Norway (SSB)
  - wholly owned holdings from ~170,000 (87%) in 1959 to ~16,000 (35%) in 2010
  - mainly owned from ~10,000 (5%) in 1959 to ~16,000 (35%) in 2010
  - mainly rented from ~2500 (1%) in 1959 to ~10,000 (23%) in 2010 -> exponential increase, with largest total farm size & average number livestock
  - wholly rented from ~14,000 (7%) in 1959 to ~3,700 (8%) in 2010
- Ownership & renting from farmer perspective
  - cheap rent compared to buying cost -> rental agreement generally mutually beneficial
  - uncertainty linked to the lacking perspectives of succession
  - however whole-rent not encouraging for young farmers -> e.g. 10 years engagement without ownership perspective is not interesting
  - increase of rented farms leads to land fragmentation -> farmers dealing with pieces of land scattered, which increase travel time & cost
- Take-home: three main factors affecting farmland control in Norway are techno-economic (e.g. machinery), agricultural policies (legislation, economic instruments) & social norms (e.g. managing isolated land for relatives)

@fjellstadPatternsChangeTwo1999
- AIM: to compare trends between an intensively cultivated area & a traditional mountain-farm landscape during second half of 20th century to illustrate opposed drivers intensification vs abandonment
- Difference in Norway compared with Europe - environmental constraints (topography & climate) technically limiting intensification + economic & social incentives from regional politics to maintain marginal farming -> not so much replacement, but co-existence of small-scale "traditional" farming systems with mechanised, high-input agriculture
- HYP: trends of landscape change regarding both land cover & landscape heterogeneity are different in the two categories and are similar to what can be observed elsewhere in Europe
- National statistics
  - Decline of both number of agricultural holdings (61%) & labour input (70%) from 1949 to 1995
  - Decline of small holdings (<10 ha) representing 90% of holdings in 1949 against 53% in 1995 -> -41%
  - Increase of larger holdings (>20 ha) representing 2% in 1949 against 16% in 1995 -> +87.5%
  - Decline of total agricultural area by 8% since 1939, but heterogeneous depending of regions & management type
    - "intensive" - collapse of permanent grassland & superficially cultivated land by 91% and meadows & pastures by 80% while surface grain & oil seeds tripled from 1939 to 1989
    - "traditional" - meadows & pastures ~stable but decline of permanent grassland & superficially cultivated land
- Land cover between 1953 and 1992
  - "intensive" - increase cultivated land & decrease pasture -> intensification
  - "traditional" - increase deciduous tree & decrease pasture -> encroachment
  - landscape heterogeneity: "traditional" 1955 ~ "traditional" 1993 > "intensive" 1953 > "intensive" 1992
- Norway vs Europe
  - Less marked decline of agricultural land in Norway (5%) compared with Europe (8%) between 1965 & 1983
  - common trends with increased mechanisation, decline in labour input, reductions in numbers of holdings & increasing size of individual farms, though average farm size still stay quite small in Norway (13 ha in 1996) compared with other countries
- Take-home: landscape "polarisation" with two extremes being large-scale intensively managed & homogeneous open landscapes on one side & small-scale, heterogeneous wooded agricultural landscapes on the other side

@blekesauneAgricultureImportanceViability1999
- AIM: report to propose targets following launching of research projects on agriculture multifunctionality by the Ministry of Agriculture
- Our study area considered as "semi-rural" according to following criteria: population density, distance from larger centres, proportion of agriculture worker, proportion of self-employed
- Farm household typology
  - full-time farm households - full-time family farm or single full-time farmer, with more than 90% of income deriving from the farm
  - part-time farm households - one full time + one off-farm, single, part-time, with between 10% and 90% of income from farm. Also spare-time farming with <10% income from farm
  - other farm household - farm residence without agricultural production & retirement farming
- Subsidies: 
  - amount of direct payments increases faster with farm size in rural areas
  - increase in direct payments through animal & cultural landscape support can stimulate production better in urban areas (1 NOK -> 1.6 NOK) than in semi-rural (1 NOK -> 1.01 NOK) or rural (1 NOK -> 1.04 NOK) areas
  
@olssonAgroecosystemsNeolithicTime1991
- AIM: to describe the characteristics & evolution of Scandinavian agro-ecosystems from the example of Ystad, Sweden
- energy & matter exchanges of pre-industrial agro-ecosystems mainly with neighbouring systems & with internal feedback processes
- Genealogy agro-ecosystems
  - 1. Initiating factor by woodland clearing: spontaneous/intentional fires, pest/diseases, climate change, clear-cutting
  - 2. Maintaining factors
    - livestock grazing - 4 components as type of livestock, single/mixed grazing, grazing pressure, time of the year/duration grazing periods
    - fodder collection - 3 components as tree leaf/twig harvest, coppice management, hay harvest
    - cultivation - many components such as crop species, seed-bed preparation, tilling, seeding, fertilizer/manure, draining, harvest, cropping systems...
- infield-outfield system established during Iron Age along with manure fertilisation of permanent arable lands, winter stalling of livestock, fodder from haymaking -> flow of nutrient from grazing outfields to infields
- Middle Ages - stronger differenciation of cultural landscape by expansion of infield-outfield system across areas with local & regional differences in topography, soils, micro-climate...
- mixed crop systems + infield-outfield provoked a "burst" in habitat, species, genetic & landscape diversity -> "The diversity - on all levels - has probably never been as high as during the existence of the infield-outfield system"
- nitrogen fertilisation of semi-natural grasslands created a disruption of nutrient flow which caused the decrease of average plant species richness

@bakkaEarlyFarmingHordaland1971
- AIM: to determine time & criteria of agriculture introduction in Western Norway

@hjelleHesitantHuntersReview2006
- AIM: determine start of agricultural activity in Western Norway from pollen records
- Some hints suggesting that domestic livestock herding has already started in the Early Neolithic (4000-3400 BC)
- Middle Neolithic (3400-2600 BC): 
  - expansion/increase grazing activity, & further towards north & east including mountain areas. However installation in fjord area not that clear. Also increased occurrence of heather.
  - MNA & more through MNB - farmer-fisher lifestyle which evolved from hunter-fisher
- Late Neolithic (2200-1700 BC) & Early Bronze Age (1700-1000): 
  - clear establishment of agriculture in the whole region with settlements along fjords areas on top of coastal, and clear utilisation of mountains
  - mixed systems with cereals, open pastures & leaf used fo fodder on climatically favourable sites
- Bones domesticated animals - some of oldest from the Middle Neolithic B (2600-2200 BC) including sheep, goats & cattle. Once agriculture settled (LN), about 5-9 sheep/goats for 1 cattle

@hamreLandcoverStructuralChanges2007
- AIM: to assess landscape changes from 1865 to 2002 in Western Norway from cadastral maps
- 1865 - mosaic grassland (~2/3) & arable field (~1/3) with different sizes & production capacity -> 459 patches
- 2002 -> only 60 patches in active use ~13%, much larger
  - decline arable fields from 13.34 ha to 0.27 ha (~2%)
  - still dominant grasslands ~36% land cover, but about same percent got abandoned
  - most vulnerable grasslands at "outermost parts" of infield (only ~20% remaining)
- Man-made structures: 58 out of 330 remained (~18%), 63 added -> half of what remained on areas still in use
- Production capacity
  - grasslands managed since 1865 located on areas with production capacity lower than mean in 1865
  - preserved man-made structures mostly occurred on land with lower production capacity than 1865 average -> steeper slope

@olssonEnvironmentalValuesNorwegian
- AIM: report on the ecological & cultural values attached to agricultural landscape in Norway

## LOW INTENSITY FARMING & CULTURAL LANDSCAPE

@ricciardiHowMuchWorld2018
- AIM: to estimate the contribution of small-scale farming in global food production based on 55 countries
- 0-2 ha farms
  - greatest contribution: 28-31% total crop & 30-34% global food supply
  - ~24% gross harvested area -> higher yield
  - largest allocation to food (55-59%)
- <5 ha ~45%; <10 ha ~55%
- Increasing farm size
  - loss crop species richness
  - increase allocation to feed (200-500 ha) & then processing (>1000 ha)

@jongmanHomogenisationFragmentationEuropean2002
- AIM: review causes & solutions to homogenisation and fragmentation in Europe
- Homogenization of European agricultural landscape, loss of regional biological and cultural diversity -> land use not anymore dictated by environmental conditions (topography, soil, climate…) but by market & technology
- Solution: sustainable and multifunctional use of the land, landscape planning (socio-economic functions within present & future dynamics of society, politically most desired development, ecological processes, long term educational objectives, genius loci & related aesthetics)

@garibaldiFarmingApproachesGreater2017
- AIM: review on alternative farming systems + analysis of quantitative impact of them on socioeconomic values
-	Failure of conventional systems to address food security (availability, access, utilization) across the globe -> current production should nourish populations but still malnourishment on one side & obesity on the other
-	Reasoning behind alternatives: regenerative system which creates fewer negative externalities and is driven by local people (empowerment)
-	About 2/3 of reviewed studies showed higher crop yield & farm profitability for alternative compared with conventional practices
-	No trade-off identified between farm profitability & crop yield -> does not support assumption that alternatives to conventional farming are low-yielding or less profitable

@haladaWhichHabitatsEuropean2011
- AIM: to list habitats from the Habitat Directive which are dependent of agricultural practices
- Agricultural habitats have in proportion a poorer conservation status compared to non-agricultural habitats
- Northern meadows and Fennoscandian pastures fully dependent on agricultural management

@bignalLowIntensityFarmingSystems1996
- AIM: characterisation of low-intensity farming systems across Europe and their importance for biodiversity conservation
- Low-intensity farmlands host a substantial proportion of European most highly valued biotopes
- Intensification & abandonment throughout whole Europe.
- Characteristics of low-intensity farmlands, common to both crops & livestock: low nutrient inputs & low output per hectare -> management techniques adapted to natural environmental constraints rather than the other way around
- All remaining high nature conservation value grasslands across Europe associated with low-intensity livestock systems
- Example: mixed farming systems (livestock + crops) provided optimal prey availability for chough all year round
- Importance of the temporal cycle of farming activity with species life cycle
- Call for preserving already existing low-intensity farming systems instead of waiting them to be converted to start restoration

@vosTrendsEuropeanCultural1999
- AIM: trends in European cultural landscape development – perspectives for a sustainable future
- Decline of primary function of agriculture (no longer main labour supplier for food production) vs new roles & demands (recreation & nature conservation)
- European cultural landscape: complex mosaics from multi-layered historical use
- Historical stages:
  -	Natural/prehistoric landscape, from Palaeolithic till ancient Greeks
  -	Antique landscape, from ancient Greeks till Medieval
  -	Medieval landscape, from early Medieval till Renaissance
  -	Traditional agricultural landscape, from Renaissance till 19th century (up to today)
  -	Industrial landscape, from mid-18th till mid-20th century (up to today)
  -	Postmodern landscapes, nowadays: 
	  - industrial production landscapes
    - overstressed multifunctional landscapes
  	- archaic traditional landscapes
    - marginalized vanishing landscapes
    - natural landscapes: relict & new nature
- Difference between:
  -	Involution (gradual endogenous transformation of preexisting structures & processes by adaptation & refinement), or how traditional landscapes have evolved
  -	Replacement, allowed by technological advances which give stronger control of physical conditions
- Engagement (belonging) vs alienation
- Perspectives: landscape multifunctionality

@phillipsNatureCulturalLandscapes1998
- Title: The nature of cultural landscapes: a nature conservation perspective
- Few if any pristine landscapes & human modification does not always relate to loss of biodiversity -> gradient
- Strong link between cultural diversity & natural diversity
- Issue with cultural landscape definition: as there are cultural aspects to almost all landscapes, it makes it all “cultural”
- Joint evolution of natural & cultural sciences, as cultural values also exist in spiritual significance & cultural importance of landscapes, and not only big monuments
- Cultural landscape categories under The World Heritage Convention:
  -	“Landscapes designed and created intentionally by man” -> biological resources
  -	“Organically evolved landscapes or continuing and evolving landscapes” (result from human responses to natural environment) -> land use characteristics (“sustainable”)
  -	“Associative landscapes” (religious, artistic or cultural associations) -> attachment of human values to nature

@plieningerTraditionalLanduseNature2006
- AIM: review/opinion on trends of traditional rural landscapes in Europe
- Traditional land use is not always synonyms of low-intensity grazing systems, especially in densely populated areas -> still even high-intensity also high biodiversity due to many nutrient & labour inputs gradients at local & regional scales
- Principles of traditional systems:
  -	Multiple use: risk minimisation through polyculture & interaction between public, common & private land-use
  -	Rotational use: spatial & temporal differentiation
  -	Recycling between outputs & inputs
  -	Low-energy economy: scarcity of energy & transport resources
  -	Spatial fuzziness: different land-use structures & processes intertwined
  
@torokGrazingEuropeanOpen2016
- AIM: special issue on alternative grazing systems diversity & functionality & socio-economic trade-offs
- Year-round grazing or traditional low-intensity grazing systems suitable for large and heterogeneous areas
- Importance of spatio-temporal variation in grazing intensities
- Main limitation of keeping traditional grazing systems is economic outcomes -> importance of relocalizing the economy for sustainable farmer business


# ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS

@anderssonSocialEcologicalAnalysis2015

@oksanenLogicRealismHypothesis2000

## ECOLOGICAL TRAITS

@loreauBiodiversitySpatialInsurance2003
- AIM: to explore hypothesis of spatial insurance heterogeneous landscape for ecosystem functioning by relying on metacommunity model with explicit resource & dispersal dynamics
- Local vs regional div
  - no dispersion
    - local div: no coexistence as only most competitive species survive
    - regional div: high as different species persist in different communities
  - up to intermediate dispersion level 
    - local div: (+) from source-sink community effects
    - regional div: temporary drop, as specialists of environmental extremes with longest local dominance outcompete other species at low dispersal, before new increase with dispersal, as intermediate species better adapted to average environmental conditions across metacommunity
  - up to coexistence all species: shifts in dominance reflect how traits match environmental conditions
  - high dispersion: (-) both local & regional div as intermediate species becomes best competitor at metacommunity scale
- Productivity
  - temporal mean: hump-shaped with peak at intermediate dispersion -> (+) correlation between average productivity & local species diversity
  - temporal variability: reversed hum-shaped with lowest at intermediate dispersion & highest at no dispersion -> (-) correlation between coefficient variation productivity & local species diversity
  - lower variability of high dispersal dominant intermediate species compared with lower dispersal dominant specialist species -> higher mean & lower variability productivity in highly connected metacommunity compared with poorly connected despite min local species richness for both
- TAKE-HOME:
  - "variations in dispersal rate generate strongly nonlinear, broadly correlated variations in local species diversity, average productivity & the coefficient of variation of productivity"
  - "spatial averaging by the intermediate-type species tends to dominate the landscape at high dispersal rates and functional compensations between species are made possible by the maintenance of species diversity"
  - "The spatial insurance effects of species diversity are highest at the intermediate dispersal rates that maximize local diversity"

## PRODUCTIVITY

@liFunctionalGroupDominance2016

@graceFactorsControllingSpecies1999
- AIM: to conceptualize general rules based on empirical evidence on control of species density in herbaceous plant communities
- 1) Underlying unimodal relationship between species density & total community biomass
  - increasing phase above some minimum habitat conditions required to support life
  - decreasing phase in highly productive habitats accumulating large amounts of biomass
- 2) Community biomass as relatively weak predictor of variations in species density
  - species density influenced by multiple additional variables
  - high amounts of community biomass preclude high species densities
- 3) Importance of disturbance & underlying gradients
- Conceptual model
  - Species density in a fixed space determined by recruitment (germination, vegetative) & extinction (natural mortality, disturbance, competitive exclusion, disease) balance
  - Recruitment depends on existing biomass of the species & others from a species pool adapted to environmental conditions
  - Extinction: complexity disturbance regimes & effects
  - Recruitment & extinction occur through activities of both living & dead plant material & subsequent habitat functioning
  - Growth rate expected to be function of environmental conditions & amount & type of biomass already present
  - Potential for differential effects of environmental gradients on biomass vs effects on species density

![](illustrations/graceFactorsControllingSpecies1999_ConceptualModel.png)


@mcnaughtonEcosystemlevelPatternsPrimary1989
- AIM: meta-analysis on linkages between plant productivity and herbivory
- Herbivore biomass, consumption & net secondary productivity positively related to primary productivity
- Highly productive ecosystems sustain a larger level of herbivory per unit of primary production, but larger herbivory leads to lower efficiency in secondary production per unit of consumption
- TAKE-HOME
  - net primary production as a good proxy of above system fluxes
  - as food-web structures related to habitat, possible to relate structural organisation of food webs to their functional properties in a more integrated & predictive way
  - possible to extrapolate the reasoning beyond the two levels (e.g. to decomposers)

@polisWhyAreParts1999
- AIM: review of different factors influencing biomass distribution & productivity across the globe
- primary productivity on land function of temperature & tightly correlated with precipitations [from other sources]
- 3 general sets of factors enabling intercession consumer control & facilitating cascades affecting community biomass on wide scale
  - appropriate extrinsic environmental conditions -> considering great spatial heterogeneity & temporal variability, relates more to circumstances conjonction -> exceptional event rather than universal
  - intrinsic characteristics of key consumers and resources -> combination efficient consumers with vulnerable but productive plants
  - multichannel omnivory & subsidized consumers

## SOIL

@sittersImpactsBrowsingGrazing2019
- AIM: review effect of grazing on nutrient cycling

@jonesNutrientStrippingGlobal2013

@geisenChallengesOpportunitiesSoil2019
- AIM: review of the global threats on soil biodiversity & associated ecosystem functions as well as management/conservation/policy/monitoring potential of soil biota

@devriesSoilFoodWeb2013
- AIM: to investigate the relationship between soil food web composition and soil function & services (C & N cycling) across different land uses (annual crop rotation, extensive rotation, permanent grassland) & countries (Sweden, UK, Czech Republic, Greece)
- Geographical location only *influence for interaction bacterial energy x N mineralisation
- Dissolved organic carbon leaching increased with biomass of fungal-feeding collembolans -> sensitive indicator for changes in labile C availability
- TAKE-HOME:
  - land use intensification reduced abundance of most functional groups
  - the predictive power of soil food web structure or functional groups was as important as abiotic factors
  - food web x C cycling mostly related to land use intensity, but not food web x N cycling

### DECOMPOSITION & STABILISATION

@vanzuijlenDecomposabilityLichensBryophytes2020
- AIM: to investigate the decomposability of bryophytes & lichens at species & community level along elevation gradient (1120-1600 masl)
- Communitiy level
  - decomposability 1480-1600 masl >* 1120-1360 masl mostly driven by community composition - relationship not linear, rather staircase with thresholds
  - N release: NS elevation -> strong negative correlation community composition & intraspecific variation leading opposite trends
  - P release: 1120-1360 >* 1480-1600 masl especially explained by community composition
  - decomposability (+)* with N & P, (-)* with relative bryophyte cover & inverse hump-shaped relationship with pH (3.9+;4.1-;4.3+)
  - best model includes: N, P, pH & bryophyte cover
- Individual level
  - best model includes: primary producer group & pH
  - pH: lowest decomposability at pH 4 independent of primary producer group

@songContributionsSoilMesofauna2020
- AIM: to investigate the effect of mesofauna on high quality (*Trifolium repens*) & low-quality (*Lolium perenne*) litter in upland grassland (1760 masl)
- Annual litter mass loss
  - litter quality: *Trifolium* >* *Lolium* only when mesofauna included
  - litter organ: leaf >* root only when mesofauna excluded
  - mesofauna: included >*(20%) excluded
- Litter loss rate
  - litter quality: *faster loss Trifolium
  - litter organ: *faster loss leaf
  - mesofauna: NS overall but *at some stages -> overall seemingly faster with mesofauna
- Annual mesofaunal contribution
  - litter quality: *Trifolium* 21% >* *Lolium* 13%
  - litter organ: root 21% >* leaf 14% for all year for Trifolium but only from 1-7 months for Lolium
- TAKE-HOME: 
  - in upland grassland, soil mesofauna facilitated litter decomposition, & more particularly when high quality litter & root organ
  - higher quality species and organ decomposed faster

@hartleyTemperatureEffectsCarbon2021
- AIM: global survey to investigate the interaction between temperature & soil texture on soil C stabilisation
- C storage in fine-textured soils with greater stabilisation capacities was less affected by temperature than when in coarse-textured soil (1.2 per 10C vs 1.9) -> negative relationship between clay content & effect of temperature on C storage
- C stored in high-latitude soils with limited capacities for stabilising OM likely to be most vulnerable to impacts of climate change

@dungaitSoilOrganicMatter2012
- AIM: review on how advances in quantitative analytical techniques have redefined the new understanding of SOM dynamics
- Main controlling decomposition factors
  - substrate quality, which includes
    - supply organic molecules for both catabolis (energy conversion) & anabolic (biosynthetic) metabolism
    - supply other nutrient elements to decomposer organisms
    - extent to which properties of substrate retard its exploitation (hydrophobia, enzyme inhibitors)
  - organisms (including enzymatic activity)
  - environment
    - temperature: "although it is well established that biological processes which drive decomposition will be more rapid at greater temperatures, being able to assign a thermal coefficient to decomposition & nutrient mineralisation has proved remarkably difficult"
    - "there is a practical difficulty of disentangling the effects on the decomposer communities of relative depletion of the most accessible components of the SOM from the direct effects of temperature on the metabolism of soil micro-organisms"
- Preservation mechanisms
  - physical protection - aggregates & organo-mineral complexes (e.g. with clay) -> adsorption affinity to mineral exceeds that of enzyme active site
  - regulation microbial activity by substrate supply - "Trigger molecule hypothesis"

@schmidtPersistenceSoilOrganic2011
- AIM: review recent findings on SOM cycling & implication of abiotic & biotic factors - *classic*
- Assumptions & verifications
  - Molecular structure does not control long-term decomposition of SOM
    - assumption: long-term decomposition rate depends on molecular structure of biomass as initial decomposition rate of plant residues correlated broadly with indices of bulk chemical composition
    - verified contradiction: molecules predicted to persist in soils have been shown to turn over more rapidly than the bulk of organic matter
  - Existence of humic substances yet to be verified by direct measurements
    - assumption: humic substances were though to comprise large, complex macromolecules that were the largest and most stable SOM fraction
    - verified contradiction: large components only a small fraction of total organic matter, dominance smaller & simple molecular structures
  - Root-derived carbon is retained in soils much more efficiently than aboveground inputs of leaves & needles
  - Physical disconnection: soil volume occupied by micro-organisms considerably less than 1%
- Ecological implication: molecular structure of plant inputs & OM with more secondary role in determining carbon residence time compared with biotic & abiotic components

@hobbieControlsCarbonStorage2000
- AIM: review & meta-analysis on factors influencing carbon turnover in high-latitude soils to predict response to global change
- Temperature: (+)* mean annual temperature, but only ~15% variation
- Moisture: NS precipitations but (+)* drainage (topography)-> low oxygen availability in saturated soil
- Substrate quality (lignin content): growth form + temperature explained ~50% variation -> decompo rate deciduous & herbaceous >* evergreen >* moss

@frouzEffectsSoilMacro2018
- AIM: review on the effect of soil fauna on litter decomposition and soil organic matter stabilization
- Priming effect theory: decrease C stock through mineralisation following a sudden source of DOC
  - "fauna that consumes food with much higher C:N ratio than in their own bodies my contribute to the release of DOC into the soil": DOM with high C:N ratio -> DOC flush -> high microbial activity & respiration
  - however experience tends to indicate that overall fauna rather decreases DOM C:N ratio
- TAKE-HOME: 
  - SOM dynamics x soil fauna context-dependent & divided into 3 categories
    - direct effect on C mineralisation, often but not always small -> can increase or decrease C sequestration depending on faunal activity & soil conditions
    - effect on microbial activity resulting in mineralisation, mobilisation or immobilisation of nutrients -> can increase or decrease C sequestration depending on faunal activity & soil conditions
    - effect of fauna on fluxes between various SOM pools -> affected by the capacity of the pools & degree to which that capacity is filled
  - in soils with high SOM content (e.g. peat soils), soil fauna may promote C mineralisation while in mineral soils with low SOM (e.g. post-mining or abandoned agricultural fields) fauna activity may promote sequestration

@davidsonTemperatureSensitivitySoil2006
- AIM: review on temperature sensitivity of carbon decomposition
- TAKE-HOME: "a significant fraction of relatively labile SOM is clearly subject to temperature-sensitive decomposition, but another significant fraction of SOM remains under environmental constraints that often obscure the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of its decomposition"

@grau-andresBryosphereLossImpairs2022
- AIM: to investigate the bryosphere (*Pleurozium schreberi* & *Hylocomnium splendens*) & micro-arthropod effects on litter decomposition (*Betula pendula* & *Pleurozium scheberi*) in boreal forests
- Micro-arthropod composition
  - oribatid (67%) > mesostigmatid (14%) > collembola (13%) > prostigmatid
  - *factors: litter type (R^2^ 0.12) > bryosphere removal (0.07) > incubation time (0.03) > moss species (0.01)
  - Collembola & oribatid associated with moss litter while other associated with birch litter
- Micro-arthropod abundance
  - litter type: moss litter >* birch litter
  - bryosphere removal: with bryosphere >* without except when *Pleurozium* after 4 months incubation
- Litter mass loss
  - litter type: birch >* moss

## MULTIFUNCTIONALITY

@bernuesQuantifyingMultifunctionalityFjord2015

@holtFoodProductionEcosystem2016
- 

@byrnesInvestigatingRelationshipBiodiversity2014
- AIM: meta-analysis to compare four approaches to characterise multifunctionality & its relationship with biodiversity based on pan-European BIODEPTH experiments -> **classic to review methods & pros/cons when assessing multifunctionality**
- Multifunctionality approaches in research
  - "single function": based on collection of functions, ask qualitatively whether more functions achieve higher values in diverse mixture than at lower levels of species richness -> univariate responses with direct information about each individual function, but without quantitative assessment
  - "turnover": whether different sets of species promote different functions -> can quantify fraction of species which contribute to one or more functions but does not consider negative effect, does not directly measure multifunctionality & requires extensive data
  - "averaging": single metric estimating average value of multiple functions achieved in a given assemblage or plot -> indicate average effect of diversity on functions but cannot distinguish between two functions at similar levels neither one function at high level against a function at low level, & single function can have large impact
  - "threshold": tallies number of functions which quantitatively exceed some pre-defined threshold of functionality in a given assemblage/plot -> measure of how diversity simultaneously influences multiple functions, but arbitrary choice of threshold, magnitude of each function imperfectly captured (whether they pass threshold by small or large margin)
-> multiple threshold approach (*described in article*)
  - minimum threshold - lowest threshold where diversity begins to have an effect -> % maximal functioning at which multifunctionality becomes influenced by changes in species richness
  - maximum threshold - value beyond which the slope first declines to be not significantly different from zero -> upper threshold beyond which diversity has no effect on multifunctionality
  - threshold of maximum diversity effect - value where diversity has its strongest effect
  - realised maximum effect of diversity - strength of relationship (slope) where diversity has strongest effect -> maximum observed effect size of species richness on number of functions surpassing threshold
-> diversity as strong driver of multifunctionality if minT is low, maxT is high & both Tmaxdiv & Rmaxdiv are likewise high

@hectorBiodiversityEcosystemMultifunctionality2007
- AIM: meta-analysis on effect of set of species favourable for selected ecosystem processes on provision of ecosystem services in experimental grasslands across Europe (BIODEPTH experiments)
- Set of influential species according to services ranged from 3.2 to 6.6 species, with only marginally significant difference between services & experiments
- still some differences: wood decomposition from 1 to 4 species, while cotton decomposition from 2 to 11 species & above-ground biomass from 4 to 8 species
- average overlap in set of influential species over a pair of processes ranged from 0.19 to 0.49 across experiments but not significant
- turnover in most important species influencing ecosystem processes ranged from 0.57 to 1.00
- trend number of required species for cumulative combination of ecosystem processes -> log curve with different slopes according to experiment -> all positive but saturating
- slopes with no clear saturation point reached with the highest turnover rate, & slopes with obvious saturation rate with the lowest turnover rate
- TAKE-HOME: different sets of species affecting different ecosystem processes, so higher biodiversity should be able to support ecosystem multifunctionality, even if the threshold between complementarity & redundancy varies across regions

@allanLandUseIntensification2015
- AIM: to assess biodiversity, functional composition & ecosystem services on 150 grasslands of different land-use intensities (German Biodiversity Exploratories) according to different multifunctionality scenarii
- METHOD: threshold-based approach -> score on each service according to whether they pass a certain threshold as a certain fraction of the maximum level across all plots -> a certain loss is acceptable but below a certain threshold loss is unacceptable & functioning is impaired
- Relationship multifunctionality x land-use intensity -> overall coherent across regions
  - when high weight on provisioning services (production only), clear positive increase of multifunctionality with increase LUI
  - weakening of relationship & decline of slope to neutral along with introduction of more ES
  - negative relationship when objective was to optimise cultural services
- Plant species richness x LUI X CWM specific leaf area -> depends on regional productivity
  - no relationship in fertile grasslands
  - in average and less fertile grassland, increase LUI decreases species richness and increase SLA
  - correlation species richness SLA - strongly negative less fertile < negative average < no correlation high
- Direct & biodiversity-mediated LUI -> depends on regional productivity
  - weak indirect through richness & SLA << direct LUI in most productive region
  - most effects negative (except for production) in most productive region
  - for low productivity stronger indirect (positive) on production side & stronger (negative) direct on cultural side
  - for moderate stronger direct (positive) on the production site & stronger indirect (negative) on the cultural side
  - Indirect effects through SLA always positive in low productive region
- Difference between species richness & SLA
  - for moderate, indirect effects best explained by changes in species richness
  - for low, indirect effects best explained by chances in SLA

@wilsonWeakStrongMultifunctionality2008
- AIM: to discuss multifunctionality concepts in relation to decision-making in agriculture at the farm-level
- Agricultural transitions:
  - non-linearity over time - agricultural post-productivism does not necessarily follow sequentially from & replace productivism
  - spatially heterogeneous - not all geographical locations affected the same way
  - structure-agency inconsistency - "structure" & "agency" nont equally affected by transitions
- Debate between authors whether productivism/post-productivism dichotomy should be transcended or whether we keep it but reframed it accordingly to definitions productivism/non-productivism as post-productivism, as such, is not the opposite of productivism
- Multifunctionality thus viewed as "a spectrum bounded by productivist and non-productivist action and thought enabling a normative conceptualisation of weak, moderate & strong multifunctionality pathways for individual farm-level transitions"
- "strong" multifunctionality observed indicators (examples): 
  - local & regional embeddedness by actors
  - high environmental sustainability through relocalisation
  - low farming intensity & productivity
  - high symbolic value of food with additional value for rural regions
  - diversification farming activities
  - more likely to be weakly integrated into global capitalist market
  - substantial mental changes through open-minded farming & rural populations
- "strong" multifunctionality as "best" multifunctionality or with best "quality" with regards to environment, farmers wealth and well-being and also "moral"
- multifunctionality funnel: potentiality depends on range of enabling factors, with for example lowland farms with more transitional potential than upland farms -> thus range of opportunity may decline, even if quality should be reachable either way
- part-time farmers: often moderately multifunctional development pathways -> lack time & commitment for purely productivist but also to move farm completely towards purely non-productivist end.
- on the strongest multifunctionality side -> subsistence farms, particularly in the South, but which are often multifunctional by necessity/custom rather than choice. On the other hand, small economically marginal farms in developed countries are more often on the weak or moderate side as they have to maximise production in order to stay economically viable
- if drivers for adoption of multifunctionality pathways among small and economically marginal farms often differ depending on development level, multifunctionality drivers for highly globalised and well capitalised farms are increasingly converging around the world -> easier to "tip the balance" from strong to weak multifunctionality or vice versa, while on large highly capitalised farms the transition is more likely to be gradual 
- influence of ownership: 
  - owner-occupiers with most control & flexibility over multifunctionality decisions
  - multimember ownership usually slower the process and influence potential pathways as path dependency also depends largely on rapidity of common decision-making structures
  - for farmers renting lands, pathways influenced by external decision-making constraints which brings no less quality per se but more constraints and slower transitions
- **to continue section 3**

@dramstadIntegratingLandscapebasedValues2001
- AIM: explore relationship between landscape and associated values such as biodiversity, cultural heritage & human appreciation through appropriate indicators, based on case-study from Norway
- 3Q programm - initiated by the Norwegian Ministries of Agriculture and Environment in order the monitor changes in the agricultural landscape and to identify effects of policy and measures pertaining to this landscape -> multidisciplinary approach
- Biodiversity: breeding birds, vascular plants, butterflies & bumblebees -> both birds and plant species richness correlated with landscape heterogeneity, but no significant relationships for insects
- Cultural heritage: linked to landscape structure through farm buildings, historical boundaries between farm ownership, fields systems & cultivated & wooded areas (likely to be affected by farming intensification) -> number of grave-fields/grave-mounds correlated with landscape heterogeneity
- Visual appreciation: important elements of landscape are openness (grain size), complexity, topography & presence of anthropogenic structures
- Issues encountered: 
  - common conceptual definition of heterogeneity across disciplines
  - very demanding process, with high level of commitment from participants
- Limitation of land-cover based maps: only 2D, missing vertical structure and temporal dimension
- Take-home: landscape-based ecological analysis could be used for cultural and aesthetic analyses, with shared indicators and methodology

@bjorkhaugMultifunctionalAgriculturePolicy2008
- AIM: to transcend productivism & post-productivist duality and propose multifunctionality concept to compare the two extremes market-oriented liberalistic Australian against market-protected small-scale Norwegian
- Productivism 
  - refers to both agricultural policy & practice which are input intensive & maximise production of commodities
  - existed previous to WWII but ideology exploded after -> closely tight to the level of support from authorities through subsidisation, price guarantees & protectionists policies
  - always higher exploitation of natural resources & inputs -> high environmental impact to be expected
- Post-productivism - less straightforward than productivism
  - followed overproduction crisis of 1980s -> policies to reduce agricultural production, budgetary coasts & environmental externalities
  - social issue: shift farmers from knowledgeable architects of land to destroyers as consequence of intensive agriculture -> increasing gap between rural & agriculture with new groups & interests/lobbies gaining influence
  - agricultural production moved into free, liberalised, marked, with emphasis on consumer demands + incentives towards environmental-friendly practices rather than general support for agricultural production
- Multifunctional agriculture
  - paradox of enhancement of local planning control & conservation practices on one side, & further intensification & conservation of food chain through global & deregulated market
  - multifunctional concept encompasses complexity of production modes across different spatial & temporal scales
  - OECD "working definition" - "key elements of multifunctionality are the existence of multiple commodity and non-commodity outputs that are joinly produced by agriculture - and the fact that some of the non-commodity outputs exhibit the characteristics of externalities or public goods when markets for these goods do not exist or function poorly"
  - but term mostly used on the scope of liberalism and conflict at the "bureaucratic" level as considered to interfere with global market -> should transcend this to use this concept to build rural & environmental sustainability
- Agricultural policies in Norway - global market & trade influence got stronger in the 1990s, with subsequent deregulation & capitalism
- Multifunctionality concept in Norwegian policies
  - first mention in research in 1998, with focus on food preparedness, rural policy, environmental issues, production of food and fibre -> multifunctionality referred to additional outputs/functions of viable "traditional" agriculture, including long-term food security, viability of rural areas, cultural heritage, land conservation and maintenance of agri-biodiversity
  - some protections on Norway's side compared to EU, with some limitations on the free trade for agriculture and fishery products within the European Economic Area
- Multifunctional agriculture in Norway
  - assumed at the policy level, with public incentives & still strong regulations compared with neighbours
  - though in practice, government encourages for effectiveness & rationalisation to be more competitive for international trade and demand for cheaper food (so rather specialisation), but at the same time support organic farming & added value -> intensification of productivist lands & multifunctional land use extensive farming systems (hay-making, grazing)
  - farmers in favour of multifunctional goals but fear cuts in financial support
  - 80% Norwegian population wants to keep agriculture at present level to preserve rural communities, Norwegian food production & cultural landscapes
  - most Norwegian farmers believe competition with non-regulated market unsustainable

- AIM: global field study to quantify how soil mosses influence ES associated with biodiversity & functional attributes
- Global distribution moss cover
  - (-) temperature seasonality & mean diurnal temperature range
  - (-) mean annual precipitation
  - (-) vascular plant cover & richness
  - no correlation air temperature, ecosystem type, soil carbon, pH, sand content, salinity
- Moss contribution to ES
  - (+)* multiservices 
  - (+)* nutrient cycling: C, N, P, Mg 
  - (+)* decomposition process: degradation glucose & lignin, soil respiration, P mineralisation 
  - (+)* plant pathogen control (++)
  - (-)* invertebrate richness
  - NS nutrient cycling (Fe, K, Zn, Mn, Cu), decomposition process (degradation starch & chitin), fungal biomass & richness, bacterial biomass & richness
- Vascular contribution to ES
  - (+)* multiservices
  - (+)* nutrient cycling: C (++), N (++), P
  - (+)* decomposition process: soil respiration, starch & chitin degradation (++)
  - (+)* microbial habitat: fungal & bacterial biomass
  - (+)* plant pathogen control
  - (+)* richness: protists
-> even when average contribution moss lower than vascular, the distribution of moss where vascular limited compensates & makes contribution significant
- Supporting meta-analysis with moss removal experiments
  - (+)* multiservices, nutrient cycling (C, B, P, Mg), soil respiration & glucose degradation
  - supports that mosses contribute to ecosystem attributes of soil carbon content & respiration rather than mosses select locations with highest functions
- Moss traits
  - stronger contribution to biodiversity & ES in locations with high cover of mat & turf mosses (*Sphagnum*, *Hylocomium*, *Ptilium*)
  - soil carbon contribution perennial moss >* annual moss

@wragePhytodiversityTemperatePermanent2011
- AIM: review on the plant diversity x ecosystem services relationships in grasslands
- Diversity x productivity -> not evident
  - neutral to positive effects
  - positive effects mostly recorded in experimental plots & not in actual agricultural fields -> effects most pronounced within first ranges (90% productivity effect reached with 5 plant studies)
  - diversity maximal at intermediate resource availability
- Additional effects on product quality, animal health, nutrient, water retention & production stability (but latter needs more observational studies)
- Selective grazing: 
  - horizontal (pasture area) & vertical (plant part) selection
  - mixed diet but tend to aim for herbage with relatively constant digestibility -> degree selectivity changes with quality herbage on offer
- Treading = trampling: compaction topsoil + creation open gaps in vegetation
- Excreta
  - dung patches can cover 5-10% grazed area each year in dairy farming -> affected area x1-6
  - urine patches can cover up to 24% pasture -> affected area -> up to x2
- TAKE-HOME: 
  - need for more observational studies as for now domination experimental plots
  - complex interactions between environmental conditions, sward composition, management & livestock behaviour -> difficult to predict grazing effects -> need for interdisciplinary research

@kremenEcosystemServicesBiologically2012
- AIM: to review comparison ES delivery between diversified farming systems & conventional -> very extensive review, good as starter (but here only selection what directly related to the thesis)
- Biodiversity
  - Multiregion European studies: overall (-) agricultural intensification & landscape simplification
  - benefits of diversified farming practices significant at local scale but tend to be more drastic in simplified landscape, while additional effect more limited in already diversified landscapes
  - cross-scale heterogeneity critical for conserving biodiversity
- Soil quality
  - higher SOM in diversified systems -> enhancement soil quality respective to 10 interrelated functions: biogeochemical cycling & nutrient retention, soil aggregate formation & stability, water infiltration & holding capacity, water decontamination, pH buffering, erosion reduction, promotion plant growth
  - greater abundance, diversity & activity soil fauna & microbes
- TAKE-HOME: 
  - diversified farming systems able to outperform conventional farming across a wide range of key ecological services
  - even if currently lower productivity per ha, compensated by enhanced environmental benefits & reduced externalities

@isbellBenefitsIncreasingPlant2017
- AIM: review on benefits increasing plant diversity for ecosystem service delivery in agroecosystems -> limited as quite crop-centered

@leprovostSupplyMultipleEcosystem2022
- AIM: to investigate the biodiversity-ES relationships in 150 grassland plots at landscape (1000 m radius), field (75 m radius) & plot (50 x 50 m) scales - Biodiversity Exploratories
- Relative importance diversity & land use predictors on individual ES
  - Pollination (R^2^ 0.11): field plant diversity > landscape land use & environmental factors > field land use > plot div
  - Shoot biomass (R^2^ 0.56): field land use > environmental factors > field div > plot div > landscape land use
  - Forage quality (R^2^ 0.35): field div & land use > landscape land use > envi > plot div
  - soil C stock (R^2^ 0.52): field div > landscape land use > field land use > plot div > envi
- Main drivers ES types (SEM) + direct/indirect effects gamma & beta div
  - cultural:
    (+) plant gamma-div (direct ++), field land use
    (-) LUI, historical grassland cover
  - AG regulating
    (+) plant alpha & gamma div (indirect +), historical grassland cover
    (-) soil pH
  - AG provisioning
    (+) LUI
    (-) plant alpha div
    - gamma div: (+) direct (forage quality) vs (-) indirect
    - beta div: (-) direct vs (+) indirect
  - BG regulating
    (+) grassland permanency & cover, topographic wetness index
    (-) LUI
- TAKE-HOME:
  - overall synergy diversity with cultural & AG regulating, trade-off with AG provisioning & neutral with BG regulating
  - contribution diversity to AG provisioning through fodder quality

@wehnRelationshipsBiodiversityEcosystem2018
- AIM: to investigate the relationships between vascular plant species richness & multiple ecosystem service indicators in grazed & abandoned meadows
- General correlations ES x diversity
  - Fodder
    - (+)* functional richness leaf dry matter content (fodder stability)
    - (+)* total abundance graminoids (fodder quantity)
    - NS SLA, LDMC & LNC
  - Nutrient cycling: (+)* legumes abundance
  - Pollination:
    - (+)¤ butterfly food
    - NS Hymenoptera food
    - (+)* flower colour
- Management effect on correlations
  - Managed: only funcrichLDMC & flower colour
  - Abandoned: funcrichLDMC, graminoids (¤), butterfly food (¤), hymenoptera food, flower colours & herbs

@bennettLinkingBiodiversityEcosystem2015
- AIM: review & opinion on three main issues affecting the incorporation of ES research into decision-making
- How are ES co-produced by socio-ecological systems?
  - Identify the role of biodiversity & other forms of heterogeneity in maintaining multiple ES
    - disentangle the effects of different dimensions of biodiversity on services at different spatial & temporal scales
    - more comprehensively account for responses of ecosystem function to multi-dimensional anthropogenic environmental forcing
  - Understand the effect of landscape & seascape heterogeneity on ES supply & test how innovative land systems, spatial planning & policy can be used to ensure more optimal landscape configurations
  - Assess the role of path-dependence & legacy effects in the supply of multiple ES (e.g. threshold effects, cross-scale effects...)
  - Understand the function of social systems in ES supply, including technological interventions, human management...
- Who benefits from the provision of ES?
  - Understand the diversity of stakeholders, their benefits from ES & their preferences for valuing ES
  - Identify spatial patterns of ES use & benefits (spatial mismatches, North-South unbalance...) using for instance spatially explicit methods (e.g. participatory GIS)
  - Identify temporal dynamics of ES use & supply
- What are the best practices for the governance of ES?
  - Characterise how institutions & agents influence the supply & distribution of ES -> requires novel hybrid methods which address the structural & functional dimensions of institutions, the preferences & capacities of agents & the integration of both with the biophysical understanding of ES
  - Identify tools, models & processes to support efficient, equitable & sustainable decision-making processes which account for feedbacks in complex socio-ecological systems (applicability, collaborative learning)
  - Understand the socio-political processes that create, support or constrain transformative pathways towards equitable, efficient & sustainable governance of ES
- From science perspective, 2 key improvements needed
  1) more integrative collaboration across social sciences, natural sciences & the humanities is required to address the challenges implied by the fact that ES are supplied & distributed by complex socio-ecological systems -> beyond multi-disciplinarity, need for integrated, transdisciplinary approaches
  2) the scientific community working on ES science alone cannot provide a full response to all of the key needs of policymakers & decision-makers -> need for knowledge co-production including local knowledge & habitus

@costanzaTwentyYearsEcosystem2017
- AIM: review on 20y of research on ES since 1997 including debates, learning processes & recommendations
- Definition ES: ecological characteristics, functions or processes that directly or indirectly contribute do human well-being: that is, the benefits that people derive from functioning ecosystems [@costanzaValueWorldsEcosystem1997; @millenniumecosystemassessmentmeaEcosystemsHumanWellbeing2005]
- Cascade concept (EF -> ES -> benefits -> values): not really supported by the authors because of 1) the introduction of human "perception" constraining benefits & values, thus limiting the reach of the ES concept & 2) the implied linearity which is not representative of the complex ecosystem-human dynamics
- Alternative:
![](illustrations/costanzaTwentyYearsEcosystem2017_ES-diagram.png)
- Classification systems:
  - MEA: United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) in 2001 + later The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity project (TEEB)
  - Common International Classification of ES (CICES) - developed to provide a hierarchically consistent & science-based classification to be used for natural capital accounting purposes
  - The Final Ecosystem Goods & Services Classification System (FEGS) & National ES Classification Systems (NESCS) - developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency
- Valuation
  - On the principle of attributing value to nature: there is always at least implicit value anyway (even when only focusing on intrinsic value of nature) & nature is not always the most valuable thing to preserve (e.g. school, home, hospital...) -> thus better be explicit & transparent to highlight trade-offs
  - Limitation of the economic valuation & methods based on aggregation of individual & self-assessed welfare (e.g. willingness-to-pay): 1) individual welfare poorly representative of the comprehensive sustainable human well-being concept which depends on multiple environmental, sociological & cultural factors across community, society & life support system scales; 2) individuals do not perceive as accurately what contribute to their well-being
  - Value types:
    1) sustainable scale (*Homo naturalis*) representing whole system preferences & requiring medium discussion level & high level of scientific inputs
    2) fair distribution (*Homo communicus*) representing community preferences & requiring high discussion level & medium level of scientific inputs
    3) efficient allocation (*Homo economius*) representing current individual preferences & requiring low discussion & scientific input levels
  - Research progress including combination of valuation methods such as "integrated valuation" or "participatory valuation"
  - Approaches to aggregate values to larger scales
    - basic value transfer: assumes constant values over ecosystem types
    - expert modified value transfer: adjusts values for local ecosystem conditions using expert opinion surveys
    - statistical value transfer: builds statistical model of spatial & other dependencies
    - Spatially Explicit Functional Modeling: spatially explicit statistical or dynamic systems models incorporating valuation
  - Range of uses for ES valuation
    - raising awareness & interest: based on total values or macro aggregates, appropriate for regional to global scales with low precision needed
    - national income & wellbeing accounts: based on total values by sector & macro aggregates, appropriate for national scale with medium precision needed
    - specific policy analyses: based on changes by policy, appropriate for multiple scales with medium to high precision needed
    - urban & regional land use planning: based on changes by land use scenario, appropriate for regional scale with low to medium precision needed
    - payment for ES: based on changes by actions due to payment, appropriate for multiple scales with medium to high precision needed
    - full cost accounting: based on total values & changes by business, product or activity, appropriate for regional to global scales (international corporations) with medium to high precision needed
    - common asset trusts: based on totals to assess capital & changes to assess income & loss, appropriate for regional to global scales with medium precision needed
- Main institutions & programs
  - Millenium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) - report, 2005
  - The Economics of Ecosystems & Biodiversity (TEEB) - report, 2008
  - Ecosystem Services Partnership - network, 2008
  - Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity & ES (IPBES) - network, 2012
  - Wealth Accounting & Valuation of ES - World Bank-led network
  - Natural Capital Project (NatCap) - academic partnership which developed, among others, the InVEST tool
  - Natural Capital Coalition (NCC) - business network, 2014
- Perspectives: concepts widely accepted but practical applications still limited by:
  - inconsistent approaches to ES modelling, assessment & valuation
  - expense of applying sophisticated enough methods to adequately answer questions
  - lack of appropriate institutional frameworks
  - mistrust or misunderstanding of science

@heinzeFarmDiversityFine2022
- AIM: to investigate ecosystem service delivery of different land use scenarii in mexican rural landscape (farms 4.6-47.6 ha), based on transdisciplinary approach
- Scenarii
  - S1 - intensified cattle ranching (agriculture): expansion + intensification across farms into riparian area first & montane forests second
  - S2 - land use zoning (land sparing): 50% farms with removal grazing + reforestation in upland forests (intensely) & riparian areas (moderate) while 50% allocated to intensified grazing
  - S3 - integrated agroforestry practices (land sharing): reforestation riparian (intensely), upland (lightly) & in agricultural lands, extensive grazing maintained across the area
  - S4 - forest restoration (reforestation): reforestation riparian (full) & upland (moderate) with extensive cattle grazing
- ES indicators
  - Forage production:
    - agriculture >* baseline >* land sharing & sparing >* reforestation
    - farm size: small farms with weaker S1 increase & stronger S2-4 decrease (-40;31;61%)
  - Firewood stocks: 
    - reforestation >* all 
    - farm size: under 25% change for all
  - Resin production: 
    - land sparing >* all >* agriculture
    - farm size: large with stronger S1 decrease (-30%) while small with stronger S2 increase (31%)
  - Tree cover: 
    - reforestation >* land sparing & sharing >* baseline >* agriculture
    - farm size: small with stronger S2 & S4 increase (25;34%), S1 decrease strong for both sizes (-26% small; -35% large)
  - Riparian corridor: 
    - reforestation >* land sharing >* baseline & land sparing >* agriculture
    - farm size: small with very high S3-4 increase (149-227%) even if large still substantial (43-87%), while large with stronger S1 decrease (-48%)
  - Tree diversity: 
    - reforestation & land sharing >* baseline & agriculture >* land sparing
    - farm size: small stronger S3-4 increase (29-27%)
- TAKE-HOME: ES trade-offs similar but magnitude very different across farm sizes (e.g. riparian corridors)

@bengtssonGrasslandsMoreImportant2019
- AIM: to provide a regional overview of grassland ES supply & demand in southern Africa & northwest Europe from workshop discussion & literature review
- Supply/demand ratio /17 ES
  - northwest Europe: 10 demand > supply; 5 ~equilibrium; 2 supply < demand
  - southern Africa: 9 ~equilibrium; 6 supply > demand; 3 demand > supply
- Demand
  - high independently of region: water services, animal production, pest control, tourism
  - high southern Africa vs low northern Europe: erosion prevention (except Denmark), medicinal plants, materials, cultural cattle
  - high northern Europe vs moderate southern Africa: pollination, hunting
- Supply
  - moderate independently of region: pollination, pest control, tourism
  - low/moderate northern Europe vs high southern Africa: water services, carbon storage, meat
- Biodiversity x ES: few evidence for direct effect of high small-scale biodiversity on ES
- ES bundles
  - northwest Europe: water services associated with fodder; GHG regulation associated with wild products; meat associated with cultural services; biodiversity independent
  - southern Africa: water services associated with fodder & meat; wild products associated with cultural services & tourism; biodiversity & GHG regulation independent

@sollenbergerGrasslandManagementAffects2019
- REVIEW: effect of grazing management on regulating & supporting ES provided by grasslands
- Soil carbon stock:
  - management intensity overall (+): increasing forage & belowground biomass (fertilisation, sowing, livestock) also increases soil organic carbon
  - species richness NS or (+): (+) could be explained by increase soil retention N & N mineralisation in species-rich mixtures
  - legumes (+): increase of overall root biomass from more N input
  - grazing inconsistent: can depend on intensity (light (+) while heavy (-)), interaction precipitation (moist x intensity (+) while dry x heavy (-)), interaction field type (C4 x intensity (+) while C3 x intensity (+/-))
  - grassland age inconsistent: may increase until reaching saturation, but depends on soil characteristics
- Nutrient cycling
  - soil largest reservoir > root-rhizome & green herbage 
  - litter composition influences net balance between mineralisation & immobilisation, but marginal compared with livestock excreta
  - excreta: feces (P, Ca, Mg & trace elements) vs urine (K & Na) vs both (N & S)
- Pollination: 
  - frequency pollinator increases with blossom cover & flowering plant species
  - affected by timing & intensity management
- TAKE-HOME: management recommendations
  - increase use of legumes
  - integrated crop-livestock systems & silvopastoral systems
  - more research emphasis on belowground processes

## WATER RETENTION

@michelSpeciesTraitsTheir2012
- AIM: to experimentally compare the effects of mixed-species & monoculture assemblages on water retention capacity
- Time to 50% water loss monoculture vs mixture 2S
  - different response according to species
  - no overall difference between monoculture & mixture, with only *Dicranum scoparium* benefiting from association with *Aulacomnium palustre*
- Shoot & canopy traits
  - 3 clusters: 
    - liverwort (1 species); 
    - longest & largest stems, greatest shoot surface area; in mixture, greatest variability shoot characteristics & smaller size
    - in mixture, differed in vertical length, either one to adapt to coexisting species or both reducing to make shorter & denser cushions
  - canopy traits differed between cushion types but not treatment
- Cushion architecture
  - T50 more strongly related to cushion traits than individual species traits
  - T50 increases with shoot density, dry mass & shoot area & decreases with cushion height

@silvaEffectMossCrusts2019
- AIM: to investigate the effect of moss cover on soil erosion & runoff after fire in eucalypt plantation
- runoff response not dependent on moss cover % 
  - amount higher moss cover consistently > lower moss cover
  - can contribute to overland flow by promoting saturation in soil surface
- soil erosion: minimum moss cover threshold of 67% reduced sediment & organic matter losses during rainy season

@huStructuralCharacteristicsMoss2023
- AIM: to investigate the changes in soil structure & soil water retention according to moss layer using 3D network models
- TAKE-HOME: higher water retention capacity with moss than without

  - Southern site: linear increase
- Predicted fuel load & carbon mass: increase with rotation interval, with Southern > Northern
- Predicted annual carbon loss due to prescribed burns
  - Northern site: highest at 10y interval & decreases to go below Southern site around 25y interval
  - Southern site: lowest at 10y interval & after 35y interval, highest at 20y interval

@wangTemperatureSensitivitySoil2013
- AIM: to experimentally investigate the response of soil organic carbon mineralisation from broad-leaf forest, coniferous forest, subalpine dwarf forest & alpine meadow to temperature
- Incubation temperature (+)* both mineralisation rate & % cumulative C mineralised for all habitats

  - bulk SOC (+) elevation

@kimEvaluatingImpactsAlternative2023
- AIM: to compare the effect of 30y grazing management (heavy continuous, light continuous, adaptative multi-paddocks) on soil organic carbon & soil health indicators in rangelands using the modified Soil and Water Assessment Tool for C flux (SWAT-C)
- Soil organic C over time
  - watershed scale: AMP slight increase > LC steady decrease > HC stronger steady decrease
  - ranch scale: AMP stable > LC slight decrease (average annual -0.6%) > HC stronger decrease (-2.6%)
- Soil quality
  - ranch scale:
    - soil nitrogen AMP & LC >* HC
    - plant available nitrogen HC >* LC & AMP
    - biomass carbon LC > AMP & HC
    - soil respiration AMP >* LC >* HC
    - carbon loss from runoff & sediment load HC >* LC >* AMP
  - watershed scale:
    - soil nitrogen AMP >* LC >* HC
    - plant available nitrogen HC >* LC >* AMP
    - biomass carbon AMP >* LC >* HC
    - net primary productivity AMP >* LC >* HC
    - soil respiration AMP >* LC >* HC
    - carbon loss from runoff & sediment load HC >* LC >* AMP
- TAKE-HOME: continuous heavy grazing leads to depletion carbon storage & increase carbon loss from runoff & sediment load at both ranch & watershed scales

@martinsenCarbonStorageLowalpine2011
- AIM: to assess the effect of grazing intensity (0-25-80 sheep/km^2^) for 7y on carbon storage in sub-alpine grassland (1050-1320 masl)
- Bulk soil C concentration: low sheep density > no grazing >* high whichever habitat (snowbed or willow-shrub)
- C stocks: low > no >* high
- Potential C mineralisation: no effect grazing treatment or habitat
- TAKE-HOME: depletion C stock under higher grazing intensity, but low grazing no difference to increase

@kalbitzBiodegradationSoilderivedDissolved2003
- AIM: to experimentally quantify biodegradation of dissolved organic matter across different soil types in order to assess its contribution to C sequestration
- DOM biodegradation
  - High biodegradation (>60% within 90 days): litter spruce & beech forest, fermentation horizon spruce forest & maize straw
  - Intermediate biodegradation (15-35%): agricultural fields manure ~ no fertilisation > NPK fertilisation
  - Low biodegradation (<10%): humified spruce & beech & all fen soil (arable, grassland, grassland in succession, almost natural forest)
- DOM properties related to microbial stability of DOM
  - UV absorbance (+)
  - aromaticity (+)
  - hydrophobicity (+)
  - carbohydrate content (-)

@soussanaFullAccountingGreenhouse2007
- AIM: to compare GHG balance in 9 grasslands with contrasted management (rotational or continuous grazing, mowing), habitat type (sown, intensive permanent & semi-natural) & nitrogen fertilisation
- Seasonal patterns net ecosystem exchanges (NS)
  - sites with more continental climate with relatively short potential growing season -> shorter C sink activity
  - daytime CO2 uptake related to respiratory fluxes at night, with magnitude summer & spring (long days) > winter
- Carbon budget - all sites (-) net ecosystem exchanges
  - strongest sink activity: highest elevation semi-natural grassland (1699 masl)
  - lowest sink activity: extensive grazing on semi-natural grassland (1040 masl)
  - high between year activity: grazing management
  - linear relationship between ratio net ecosystem exchanges and difference between C grazing intake and C cutting export -> hay-making with better sequestration potential on-site compared with grazing

@schulzeEuropeanCarbonBalance2010
- AIM: to review the European C fluxes & its implications for GHG emissions
- Gross primary productivity: grassland (-1343 gC/m2y) > cropland (-1120) > forest (-1108) > peatland (-690)
- Net primary productivity: grassland (-750 gC/m2y) > cropland (-551) > forest (-518) >* peatland (-295)
- Net biome productivity biomass: forest (-55 gC/m2y) > all (0)
- Net biome productivity soil: grassland (-57 gC/m2y) > forest (-20) > peatland (-19) > cropland (+10.9)
- Net GHG balance: forest (-19 gC/m2y) > grassland (-14) > cropland (+40) > peatland (+44)

@poeplauTemporalDynamicsSoil2011
- AIM: meta-analysis on temporal dynamic of soil organic carbon under 5 different land use changes
- cropland to grassland: 46 Mg/ha at 0y; +40% after 20y; +128% after 100y; equilibrium after 120y
- grassland to cropland: 115 Mg/ha at 0y; -36% after 20y & 100y; equilibrium reached at 17y
- forest to cropland: 147 Mg/ha at 0y; -31% after 20y; -32% after 100y; equilibrium reached at 23y
- cropland to forest
  - included forest floor: 68 Mg/ha at 0y; +22% after 20y; +117% after 100y; equilibrium after 120y
  - only mineral soil: 56 Mg/ha at 0y; +16% after 20y; +83% after 100y; equilibrium after 120y
- grassland to forest
  - included forest floor: 86 Mg/ha at 0y; -4% after 20y; +28% after 100y; equilibrium after 200y
  - only mineral soil: 77 Mg/ha at 0y; -4% after 20y; -7% after 100y; equilibrium after 150y
- TAKE-HOME: 
  - best positive effect cropland to grassland conversion
  - grassland abandonment on mineral soil lead to C loss, while on organic soil becomes sink again after some decades

@conantGrasslandManagementImpacts2017
- AIM: review on management effect on grassland soil carbon stock
- Soil improvement methods overall increased carbon stocks: reclamation (grass sowing into mining overburden) > conversion crop to grass > earthworm > fertilisation, fire, grass ley & grazing
- Only rather negative influence is conversion from native to grass
- TAKE-HOME: fertilisation increases grassland carbon sequestration potential, but sowing rather neutral/negative

@quinCallunaVulgarisdominatedUpland2015
- AIM: to compare C net ecosystem exchange between upland grass-dominated & building phase *Calluna*-dominated communities (350-400 masl)
- Grass-dominated: *Nardus stricta*; *Anthoxanthum odoratum*, *Festuca ovina*; *Agrostis capillaris*, *Deschampsia flexuosa*
- CO2 fluxes (observed)
  - environment*: higher fluxes during months with higher temperature and photosynthetic active radiation, & inversely
  - net ecosystem exchange:
    - overall Calluna >* by 33% (in negative) grass-dominated
    - only spring grass-dominated > Calluna
  - total respiration: grass-dominated >* Calluna, with strongest differences during spring & early summer
  - soil respiration: grass >(NS) Calluna
  - gross primary productivity NS
- TAKE-HOME: Calluna dominated vegetation better sink than grass-dominated due to higher total respiration for grass-dominated

@kopittkeAgeManagedHeathland2013
- AIM: to investigate the carbon balance over a Calluna heathland community life-cycle (chronosequence 11-18-27y)
- Total C stocks (aboveground + belowground) young > middle > old
- Aboveground C: increase from young to middle & stable to old
- Belowground C: biggest stock (6-9 times aboveground) -> young community mineral 55% > organic 35% > aboveground 8%

@liLongtermTemporalPatterns2023
- AIM: to investigate the carbon balance over Calluna heathland ecosystem life-cycle (chronosequence 0-12-19-28y after cutting)
- Compartment C fluxes
  - annual rate gross photosynthesis: young >* old, especially in summer
  - ecosystem respiration: young >* old both annually & during every season
  - heterotrophic respiration NS
  - ratio heterotrophic/ecosystem respiration: increases with age
  - ratio autotrophic/ecosystem respiraion: decreases with age
- Modelled C fluxes: temperature sensitivity gross photosynthesis & saturation constant decreased with vegetation aging
- Annual C balance: all ages C sources except young community (12y)
  - 0y: heterotrophic respiration from bare ground dominant contributor
  - C compensation point ~4y
  - 12y: carbon sink from high gross photosynthesis
  - C payback ~16y
- Cumulative C balance
  - 0-7y: atm/source
  - from 7y sink: hump-shaped peaking ~16y
- TAKE-HOME: young heathland communities (15y) as better C sink, after 16y payback -> heath rejunevation positive for carbon sequestration

## LAND ABANDONMENT

@eldridgeImpactsShrubEncroachment2011

@austrheimSynergiesTradeoffsEcosystem2016
- AIM: meta-analysis to assess synergies & trade-offs between ES & biodiversity under different sheep densities (0-25-80 per km^2^) in Norwegian alpine landscape
- ES x land use
  - Abandonment decreases habitat openness & meat production 
  - Intensification increases meat production & decreases plant productivity & cover
  - NS nitrogen cycling, carbon storage in soil, plant functional group abundance & birds for hunting
- Biodiversity x land use
  - bryophyte richness maintained >* abandoned
  - spider richness: increase >* maintained BUT abandonment >* increase while abandonment vs maintained NS

@johansenCeasedGrazingManagement2019
- AIM: to assess the effect of grazing cessation on semi-natural grassland ecosystem services in Norway using biophysical indicators
- ES indicators
  - nutrient cycling: abundance legumes, leaf dry matter content, specific leaf area
  - forage quality: leaf nitrogen content, cover graminoids
  - aesthetics: herb/grass ratio, number flower colours, canopy cover, cover shrub layer
  - carbon storage: cover shrubs & tree trunks, LOI
  - albedo: canopy cover, cover shrub layer
  - pollination: abundance food plant species for butterflies & Hymenoptera
- *Drivers: 
  - land use: cessation (-) all ES except carbon storage (+) & pollination (NS)
  - fertility x land use: carbon storage
  - pH x land use: species richness -> stronger land use effects in base-rich soils
  - precipitation x land use: nutrient cycling
  - temperature x land use: species richness, aesthetics & albedo -> stronger land use effects in warmer climates
- TAKE-HOME: grassland abandonment leads to overall loss of ecosystem services, and the magnitude of loss is greater in fertile soils & warmer climates

@maestreAmountPatternGrassland2007
- AIM: to experimentally test the response of simplified plant assemblages (*Lolium perenne*, *Plantago lanceolata*, *Anthoxantum odoratum*, *Holcus lanatus*, *Trifolium repens*) to nutrient spatial heterogeneity & water temporal heterogeneity
- Assemblage biomass
  - Nutrient heterogeneity: (+)* biomass independently of water availability
  - Nutrient availability: (+)* biomass independently of water availability
  - Water heterogeneity:
    - high water availability: biomass regular >* pulse watering
    - low water availability: biomass pulse >* pulse watering
- Belowground:aboveground ratio (BAR)
  - Nutrient heterogeneity: (-)* BAR at low & medium water availability & at medium & high nutrient availability
  - Nutrient availability: (-)* BAR at low (dependent on water heterogeneity) & medium water availability
  - Water heterogeneity: (-)* BAR at high nutrient availability
- Root foraging pattern precision
  - (+)* with nutrient heterogeneity & availability
  - (-)* with water availability
- Root depth allocation: more roots within first 15 cm of soil under increased nutrient heterogeneity & availability
- Species-specific responses -> Nutrient heterogeneity as most influential driver for all species but *Holcus*
  - Nutrient heterogeneity: 
    - (+)* *Lolium perenne* (particularly at low nutrient availability)
    - (-)* *Plantago lanceolata*, *Anthoxantum odoratum* (under regular watering), *Trifolium repens*
  - Nutrient availability
    - (+)* *Trifolium repens*, *Plantago lanceolata*
  - Water heterogeneity:
    - pulse >* regular *Trifolium repens*, *Plantago lanceolata*
  - Water availability:
    - (+)* *Holcus lanatus*, *Plantago lanceolata*
    - (-)* *Lolium perenne*
- TAKE-HOME
  - both nutrient availability & spatial heterogeneity increase total plant aboveground biomass
  - nutrient spatial heterogeneity as the most important driver for species-specific responses

@fransenSoilNutrientHeterogeneity2001
- AIM: to experimentally compare the competitive ability of *Festuca rubra* & *Anthoxantum odoratum* according to soil nutrient heterogeneity
- Treatments: monoculture vs mixture + fine-grained (higher concentration per grain) vs coarse-grained heterogeneity vs homogeneous (same concentration overall)
- Homogeneous: from year 1 
  - Festuca better competitor, (-) intraspecific 
  - Anthoxantum (-) interspecific
  - high biomass all species
- Coarse: from 2nd year even competition & inter/intra specific strengths between species - high biomass all species
- Fine: 
  - Festuca (-) both intra & interspecific, 
  - Anthoxantum (-) interspecific 
  - no better competitor, low biomass all species
- TAKE-HOME:
  - nutrient heterogeneity enhance competition ability Anthoxantum compared with Festuca in homogeneous environment -> more effective root foraging behaviour
  - higher biomass & growth rate both species for coarse compared with fine

@steinEnvironmentalHeterogeneityUniversal2014
- AIM: meta-analysis to investigate the strength & direction relationship between spatial heterogeneity & plant & animal species richness
- Heterogeneity type: land cover, vegetation, climate, soil, topography
- Overall rather positive effect of environmental heterogeneity on species richness: 1012 (758)* (+) > 134 (59)* (-)
- Heterogeneity type coarse
  - all positive* but different magnitudes
  - average effect size topography & vegetation* > soil & land cover > climate*
- Heterogeneity type fine: all positive* except soil variables & land patchiness
- Model comparison according to subgroup SG1 (elevation diversity & land cover diversity) & SG2 (vegetation complexity & plant diversity)
  - SG1
    - M1 Methodological influence: larger effect size with unequal areas, larger spatial grain & smaller extent
    - M2 + Location-related: effect size in mixed habitat >* forested
    - M3 + Taxon-related: NS vertebrate vs invertebrate whichever taxonomic grain
  - SG2: all NS but grain -> larger effect with larger spatial grain
- Herbivores only: effect size land cover & topography >* plant diversity
- TAKE-HOME:
  - resolution & methodological choices strongly influence magnitude heterogeneity effect
  - topography & vegetation strongest drivers even if all levels were found positive

@adlerEffectGrazingSpatial2001
- AIM: to identify grazing mechanisms that enhance and decrease vegetation spatial heterogeneity through literature review & modelling
- Interaction grazing pattern/vegetation pattern should predict spatial heterogeneity response
  - patch grazing unrelated to vegetation pattern: heterogeneity increases if grazing pattern weaker than vegetation pattern -> non-verified in literature
  - selective grazing dependent on vegetation pattern: heterogeneity increases if grazing increases contrast among vegetation types -> verified in literature
- Model comparison
  - disturbance: 
    - homogeneous grazing: decreased heterogeneity both species 
    - selective grazing: heterogeneity decreased for selected species but increase for non-selected species (colonisation by non-selected species)
  - environmental heterogeneity (increase mortality competitive):
    - homogeneous grazing: hetero competitive species increase, hetero disperser slight increase
    - selective grazing competitive: hetero competitive indifferent, hetero disperser increase
    - selective grazing disperser: hetero competitive indifferent, hetero disperser decreased
  - neighbourhood interaction constraining colonisation: 
    - hyp: grazing reduces negative interactions & increase bare ground -> homogenisation whichever selected species 
    - hetero both species decreased under both selective & homogeneous grazing
- TAKE-HOME: local dispersion & neighbourhood interaction important processes in explaining spatial effects of grazing

@hesterForagingBehaviourSheep1999
- AIM: experiment to compare foraging behaviour of sheep & red deer on fragmented heather/grass mosaic
- sheep consistently preferred small grass patches, more variable for red deer
- faster bite rates on grass compared to heather
- topography (slope line, uphill, downhill) affected the grazing time of animals

@wallisdevriesForagingStrategyCattle1994
- AIM: experiment to test patch selection & foraging strategies of cattle between patches of different sizes & structures in *Agrostis/Festuca* and *Lolium* grasslands
- higher % of digestible organic matter in *Lolium* grasslands
- variation of digestibility more related to differences between patch types (short, tall, stemmy) than proportion dominant species
- bite rate & size inversely related -> high bite rate in short patches to low in stemmy patches
- TAKE-HOME: preference for shorter swards (young growth)

@wallisdevriesImportanceScalePatchiness1999
- AIM: experiment to test the effect of patchiness on cattle movement & selectivity
- fundamental differences between grazing ungulates & ruminants (from other literature resources)
  - grazing ungulates focus on short, leafy swards with high nutrient concentration, which could be traded-off against lower intake rate [@]
  - ruminants constrained by passage rate through their digestive track, so they would favour higher daily intake against immediate highly nutritive immediate intake
- Take-home
  - patch selection aimed at patch type with highest daily digestible intake
  - search pattern (proportion steps in preferred patch) non-random
  - selectivity increased when integrating the selection of feeding stations with selectivity in movement to the preferred patch
  - selectivity & efficiency of feeding station selection greater in coarse-grained environment
  - no adjustment of animal movement, bite number or residence time according to patchiness grain

@cromsigtResourcePartitioningSavanna2006
- AIM: experiment to test how native grazers of different sizes interact with variation of resource mosaic grain & patch quality in savanna
- take-home: animals can react differently to the mosaic grain of resources, some will be indifferent (e.g. zebra, white rhino) while other will avoid fine-grained (e.g. warthog)

@dunningEcologicalProcessesThat1992
- AIM: description/conceptualisation of two main landscape features (composition & spatial arrangement) through 4 basic ecological processes (landscape complementation, landscape supplementation, source-sink dynamics, neighbourhood effect)
- Definitions
  - Landscape physiognomy - features associated with the physical layout of elements within the landscape (patch isolation, contagion) -> spatial/structural arrangement
  - Landscape composition - relative amount of each habitat (dominance, relative richness, diversity)
- Landscape complementation - how far apart are patch types providing necessary **non-substitutable** resources within the landscape (e.g. foraging, winter roost, breeding)
- Landscape supplementation - how far apart are patch types providing necessary **substitutable** resources with the landscape -> population could be sustained on a "too small" patch if similar are close-by
- Source/sink relationships - productive patches as sources of emigrants for less productive patches -> increase of total population with new sinks, but the more sinks the fewer sources are found
- Neighbourhood effects - influence of contiguous patches higher than more distant patches & edge effects

@concepcionEffectsLandscapeComplexity2008
- AIM: to suggest conceptual model for relationship between landscape complexity & ecological effectiveness of Agri-Environment Schemes (AES)
- Theoretical response of biodiversity to complexity: "S" shape, with a minimum threshold before increase and a plateau reached at a "saturating" level of complexity
- HYP: landscape complexity either does not affect (1), decreases (2), increases (3), increases for in-between complexity extremes but decreases for too simple or too complex landscape (4) effectiveness of AES
- METHOD: species density (number species per field) & abundance of 5 target groups - vascular plants, birds, bees, spiders, grasshoppers/crickets
- RESULTS:
  - main gradients - amount of natural habitats (PC1); connectivity & corridor availability (PC2); shape complexity focal field (PC3)
  - effect of landscape complexity on AES efficiency mostly NS
  - positive effect - PC3 x spider diversity
  - negative effect - PC2 x grasshopper + bird diversity + plant abundance
- TAKE-HOME: effectiveness of AES seems high at intermediate levels of landscape complexity

@cloughFieldSizesFuture2020
- AIM: review around trade-offs between farmer income & biodiversity mediated by field size at local and landscape scales
  - links between field size and biodiversity, including underlying processes
  - historical background of differences in field size
  - farm economic effects of field size, including through ES to crops
  - trends in agricultural practices & policy with likely impacts on field size
  - recommendations for conserving and restoring fine-grained agricultural landscapes to restore biodiversity
- Consistent negative influence of increasing field size on biodiversity -> but should be careful not to over generalise as some species thrive on large open habitats
  - decrease density field edges
  - decrease crop diversity at finer scale
  - sampling effect -> absence of crops from the landscape in certain year
- "landscape-wide patterns of field size are linked to patterns of land ownership & to land management"

@fynnManagingBrowsingGrazing2019
- AIM: to review the fundamental role of heterogeneity in relation to native ungulate populations
- functional resource heterogeneity refers to "spatiotemporal variability in forage resources, whereby different patches in the landscape vary in their probability of meeting the specific nutritional needs of a grazing or browsing ungulate over time (between seasons or years)"
  - inherent heterogeneity (spatially fixed), driven by for instance geology or mean annual rainfall -> usually linked to topography, climate or edaphic factors
  - induced heterogeneity (vary across space & time), by patchy effects of climate or grazer

# HEATHLAND HABITAT

## SUBALPINE HEATHLAND

@austrheimLargeScaleExperimental2008
- AIM: to assess the effect of sheep density (0-25-80 sheep/km^2^) on plant composition in low alpine region (1050-1300 masl)
- NS grazing on functional group cover or community
- Contrasting responses within main functional groups -> needs finer assessment based on species life-history traits
- TAKE-HOME: effect on species abundance between no & intensive grazing, but no difference with low-intensity

# DIVERSITY AND FUNCTIONALITY ACROSS SCALE

@sjodinInfluenceGrazingIntensity2008

@cousinsPlantSpeciesOccurrences2008

@freestoneRegionalEnrichmentLocal2006
- AIM: to investigate the relationships between plot (1 m^2^), local (50-m stream segment) & regional (stream) species richness of wetland plant communities
- TAKE-HOME: both plot & local species richness positively correlated with regional species richness

@dixonhamilCrossscaleContradictionsEcological2016
- AIM: to review & compared methods for cross-scale analyses & highlight the effect of spatial  heterogeneity in macrosystems
- Extrapolation issues when not integrating spatial heterogeneity when dealing with coarse spatial scales
  - spatial transmutation: assuming that relationships revealed from aggregated data can be used to make predictions about the individuals used to devise these aggregated data
  - modifiable areal unit problem: statistical anomaly when changing size of spatial unit when analysing data collected over large areas (remote sensing)
  - zone effect: bias due to placement of spatial units
  -> cross-scale contradictions most problematic when conducting analyses at scales differing from those of data collection
- Existing methods
  - scale choice: "to identify the characteristic scale of response by modeling the relationship between the response variable & explanatory variables of interest" -> easier said than done both from data collection & analysis perspectives
  - upscaling: 
    - conditions: no collinearity among explanatory variables, linear relationships at finer scales & no shift from linear to nonlinear relationships across scales
    - if assumptions not met & spatial heterogeneity known is the sole source of spatial transmutation, expected values from nested subsections can be used to derive corase-scale estimates
  - downscaling: hierachical Bayesian models -> assume that the scales of data are nested & defines the model through a hierarchy, but unable to account for missing explanatory variables which have strong influence on response variable
- Proposed statistical approach
  - "From a statistical point of view, the contradiction means that the fitted models are an insufficient representation of the underlying ecological process or processes"
    - only linear terms included when there should be higher orders
    - absence of explanatory variables significantly impacting the modeled response variable
  - spatial heterogeneity usually only partially accounted for in statistical models due to the ignorance of all possible contributing variables 
    - "how to account for the factors which drive spatial heterogeneity in a given ecological process without explicitly knowing all the contributing factors ?"
    -> to consider spatial heterogeneity driven by latent random variables as such in mixed effects models & random fields
- Mixed effects model: associate fixed (explanatory variables associated with the entire population) & random (important factors driving spatial heterogeneity) effects by dividing larger study regions into smaller subregions each with independent random slope & intercept estimates for the modeled ecological process

@nashDiscontinuitiesCrossScale2014
- AIM: conceptual framework underlying the discontinuity hypothesis in ecological system to address multi-scale interactions
- Conceptual framework
  - hierarchy theory: ecosystem structure & dynamics dominated by the influence of a small set of organisms & abiotic processes operating at specific temporal & spatial scales -> "each level in this nested hierarchy of variables is controlled by processes sufficiently different in speed & size to introduce discontinuities in the distribution & pattern of ecosystem attributes"
  - discontinuity hyp: "where ecosystem patterns are persistent over ecological time scales, biological processes unrelated to the original structuring processes will become entrained by and adapted to the pattern across scales" -> e.g. organism attributes may adapt to discontinuous landscape pattern which reflect resource opportunity, but these are mediated by scale interaction organism/landscape which are correlated to body size
- Discontinuity vs emergent neutrality
  - emergent neutrality hyp: competitive interactions alone can generate a discontinuous body mass distribution -> locations of the aggregation of species result from stochasticity so differ according to community
  - discontinuity: locations of the aggregation of species result from interaction biota with habitat structure so similar across sites with same habitat
- Identification of scales
  - issue arbitrary choice: 1) may not be relevant for all species/processes of interest & 2) relevance of theoretical models to empirical results may be masked due to scale mismatch
  - Opportunities discontinuity analysis
    - differentiate between systems exhibiting scale invariance of variables/processes vs discrete intrinsic scales
    - reduce the arbitrariness of scale selection & increase the likelikood of designing effective multi-scale studies
    - delimit the appropriate scales for ecological surrogates
    - predict congruence in the response of species to disturbance or environmental drivers
    - partition out variance associated with scale effects prior to running other analyses
  - evaluation discontinuities body size distribution relatively well studied, but less for other community traits/characteristics (e.g. biomass)
- Identification of nonlinearities & regime shifts: "Temporal changes in the structure of body size distributions could be used to forewarn of reorganisation within a system leading to a new regime."
- Functional distributions
  - nonrandom patterns: "functionally similar species with same body size aggregation subject to stronger interactions than those operating at different scales"
  - redundancy: scale-specific distribution of functions may be used to quantify the degree of cross & within scale redundancy of an assemblage
  - resilience: 
    - importance of considering species abundance, not reflected by functional distribution
    - connectivity: "Characterising distributions of function across scales will highlight the likely spatial extent of mobile links and identify vulnerabilities due to a narrowing of the range of scales over which an assemblage is functionally effective"

@neffCrossscaleEffectsLand2019
- AIM: to assess the effect of land use at local (plot) & landscape (250 m to 2000 m radius) levels on functional diversity (alpha & beta) & composition of herbivorous arthropods in 3 regions of Biodiversity Exploratories
- Variables: local management intensity, landscape management intensity, landscape suitability (% grassland & semi-natural habitats), landscape diversity
- Morphological traits
  - Auchenorrhyncha
    - *local management: 3/9 body volume (-), wing length (+), antenna length (+)
    - *landscape management: 2/9 hind femur shape (+), hind/front leg ratio (+)
    - *landscape suitability: 5/9 body volume (+), wing length (-), leg length (-), hind/front leg ratio (+), body shape (+)

    - *landscape management: 1/9 eye width (+)
    - landscape suitability NS
    - landscape diversity: 1/9 hind/front leg ratio (-)
  - Orthoptera
    - *local management: 2/9 thin body shape (+), eye width (+)
    - landscape management, suitability & diversity NS
- Diversity
  - *local management: (-) species richness all taxa & Shannon Orthoptera, but no effect functional diversity
  - *landscape management: (-) species richness all but Orthopteran, other indicators NS
  - *landscape suitability: (-)
- Trait clustering
  - Auchenorrhyncha
    - Axis 1: high local & landscape management intensity associated with longer wings & thinner femora
    - Axis 2 (-): high landscape diversity & suitability associated with shorter wings, legs & antenna, bigger bodies & thinner femur
    - Axis 2 (+): low landscape diversity & suitability associated with shorter hind legs, thicker body & femora, bigger eyes & longer rostrum
  - Heteroptera
    - Axis 1: low landscape suitability & low management intensity associated with shorter legs & antenna, thicker body & longer rostrum
    - Axis 2 (+): high local & landscape management intensity associated with longer wing, leg & hind leg & shorter rostrum
    - Axis 2 (-): high landscape suitability associated with longer legs, thinner femur & body, & shorter rostrum
- Functional beta-diversity
  - *local management: increase up to plateau for all taxa ~same threshold
  - *landscape management: steady but slow increase up to late threshold with sudden peak for Auchenorrhyncha, only late peak for others
  - *landscape suitability
    - Heteroptera: increase up to plateau 
    - Auchenorrhyncha: linear increase
    - Orthoptera: curvy increase
  - *landscape diversity: only Auchenorrhyncha with slow linear increase
- TAKE-HOME:
  - morphological trait responses: most sensitive taxa Auchenorrhyncha, most sensitive trait hind/front leg ratio, & more important driver across taxa is local management
  - trait clustering: high intensity management associated with more mobility, low landscape suitability associated with ground associated species, high landscape suitability associated with bigger less mobile Auchenorrhyncha & grass-associated Heteroptera
  - diversity: local management stronger effect, with overall decrease of species richness, but no effect on functional diversity
  - functional beta-diversity: decreases with local management intensity & mostly increases with landscape suitability

@petersCrossScaleInteractions2007
- AIM: to provide a cross-scale interaction framework focusing transfer processes and spatial heterogeneity at the intermediate between broad & fine-scale patterns **LA BASE**
- Cross-scale interactions = processes at one spatial or temporal scale interacting with processes at another scale that often result in nonlinear dynamics with thresholds
- Related framework
  - "finer scales provide the mechanistic understanding for behavior at a particular scale, and broader scales provide the constraints or boundaries on that behavior"
  - scale domain characterised by a certain stability of relationships between patterns & processes -> thresholds are a regime shift driven by change in pattern/environmental driver
  - cascading bottom-up consequence as one threshold crossing at one scale can unfold the crossing of overarching thresholds -> e.g. wildfire
    - trigger: lightning strike on tree
    - initial fire spread: depends on individual tree properties (dryness, density & type of leaves)
    - patch spread: interaction tree properties with patch characteristics (connectivity, size)
    - multi-patches: interactions fuel load characteristics connecting patches & within patches & individual tree properties
    - processes hierarchy over time: starts with tree scale, to within-patch variation, to among-patch connectivity
    - at very large scale: land-atmosphere interactions producing fire-generated weather overwhelming local fire dynamic processes
  -> **hierarchical interaction among processes at different scales**
- Framework for cross-scale interactions and changing pattern-process relationships
  - Hypothesis: "intermediate-scale properties of transfer processes and spatial heterogeneity determine how pattern-process relationships interact from fine to broad scales"
  - Scales: fine (individual) - intermediate (group) - broad (landscape, region, globe)
  - Effects from changes in external drivers or disturbances:
    - bottom-up effect followed by top-down feedback overwhelming fine & local processes: e.g. livestock grazing lowering competitive ability grass -> encroachment by shrubs -> dispersion rather than competition drives colonisation to nearby patches -> broad-scale wind erosion can enter the loop & overwhelm competition & dispersion processes into deepening grass/shrub imbalance
    - direct top-down effect overwhelming fine & local processes: e.g. regional long-term drought
  - Linear extrapolation worth considering only if
    - intermediate transfer processes & spatial heterogeneity not important
    - negligible transfer processes but high spatial heterogeneity -> stratification area to obtain homogeneous, independent cells where linear extrapolation can be used to aggregate within cells
  - But "when connections among spatially heterogeneous areas via transfer processes are important, then a spatially-explicit approach is needed that accounts for the rate, magnitude & direction of materials being transported" -> single scale observation insufficient
  - Effects transfer processes & spatial heterogeneity
    - amplification: when rate of change in system properties increases nonlinearly -> e.g. wildfire, emphasized by heterogeneity (connectivity & cascading events)
    - attenuation: when rate of changes decreases through time -> e.g. tsunami, with wave amplitude decreases as wave form increases, thus heterogeneity becomes increasingly important as distance from sismic event increases
- Methodologies & design
  - "measuring responses at multiple scales simultaneously & then testing for significant effects of variables at each scale"
  - stratified-cluster experimental designs
  - statistics: non-stationarity & nonlinear time series analysis

@liuFunctionalBeetleDiversity2014
- AIM: to assess the effect of multi-scale factors (land use, landscape, region) on beetle functional groups (herbivore, decomposer, predator) abundance & community composition in 3 regions (part of Biodiversity Exploratories)
- Variables: landscape Shannon diversity index, land use intensity index, region (wet, intensive + arable, mosaic)
- Abundance:
  - herbivores: NS
  - *predators: region -> wet > intensive > mosaic
  - *decomposers:region & interaction landscape diversity x LUI -> increase with LUI in highly diverse landscape but decrease with LUI in low diverse landscape
- Community composition
  - *herbivores: region (5.8%)
  - *predators: region (5.4%), LUI (2.3%) & interaction landscape diversity x LUI (3.8%)
  - *decomposers: region (9%)
- TAKE-HOME:
  - largest spatial scale with strongest effect on both abundance & community composition of beetles
  - interactive effects land use & landscape for decomposer abundance & predator composition

@raatikainenImpactsLocalRegional2007
- AIM: to determine primacy environmental factors of different scales at explaining plant community composition at two grain sizes (50 x 50 m & 1 x 1 m) in semi-natural grasslands
- Variable categories: regional, soil, land-use, habitat, heterogeneity
- Coarse grain size
  - all categories significant
    - regional (12%): temperature & province
    - soil (18%): cation, P, pH, water soluble salts
    - soil type (6.4%)
    - land use (22.6%): grazing intensity, time since abandonment
    - habitat (16.5%): solar radiation, direction, % shrubs & trees, dryness, stoniness
    - heterogeneity (13.7%): number soil types & range field layer, litter, stoniness & pH
  - partitioning
    - regional: independent climate variation only accounted for ~40% variation, the rest shared with other categories
    - independent local accounted for ~33% total variation: land use (13%) > soil (5.7%) & soil type (4.8%) > heterogeneity (2.3%) > habitat (2.2%)
  - ordination: CCA1 represented nutrient gradient while CCA2 represented grazing intensity
- Fine grain size (regional category excluded)
  - all categories significant but soil type marginally significant
    - site ID (covariate) (25%)
    - soil (1.4%): cation, P, pH, water soluble salts
    - soil type (0.3%)
    - land-use (1.1%): grazing intensity
  - partitioning:
    - 25% between site vs 2.7% within site
    - between site dominated by site ID fraction
    - within site independent variables accounted only for 0.3-1.2% total variation
  - ordination: CCA mostly explained by land-use intensity, nutrients, pH & stoniness
- TAKE-HOME:
  - for coarse grain size: 
    - land use as strongest full & independent factor, followed by edaphic variables
    - *regional influence but 60% of it shared with local variables
  - for fine grain size: mostly explained by between-site variation, very low explanatory power of local variables

@scherrerDisentanglingProcessesDriving2019
- AIM: to assess the effect of fine-scale spatial partitioning in comparison with habitat filtering & limiting similarity on trait-based assembly of alpine grasslands at coarse plot (2 x 2 m) and fine subplot (20 x 20 cm) scales
- Definition
  - Habitat filtering: "only species sharing similar adaptation to cope with prevailing environmental conditions can co-occur" -> trait convergence
  - Limiting similarity: "species show limiting similarity (i.e. alpha-niche differentiation = differences in the traits related to the ways the species compete for a common resource) to coexist" -> trait divergence
  - Fine-scale spatial partitioning: "species coexist at the plot level because they segregate in space due to endogenous or exogenous spatial heterogeneity" -> segregation of traits among subplots within a plot
- Assembly processes
  - Habitat filtering: *predominance at coarse scale for all traits (except for leaf dry matter content) but not at fine scale
  - Limiting similarity: 
    - *predominance at fine scale for all traits
    - *effect at coarse scale for all traits except vegetation height
  - Trait-dependent
    - convergence: strongest for vegetation height & leaf nitrogen content
    - divergence: strongest for specific leaf area & leaf dry matter content
  - Habitat filtering & limiting similarity as opposing forces driving functional patterns, unrelated to species richness
  - Fine-scale partitioning: no predominance but *correlated with limiting similarity
- Environmental gradients
  - only vegetative height (R^2^ = 0.6) & specific leaf area (R^2^ = 0.42) varied with elevation, while leaf nitrogen content & leaf dry matter content completely independent
  - only weak effect at plot level & negligible at subplot level for both habitat filtering & limiting similarity
  - trends from combined growth traits: habitat filtering strongest in productive low elevation habitats while limiting similarity strongest in cold climates at high elevations
  - no signal fine-scale spatial partitioning
- TAKE-HOME:
  - habitat filtering influence prominent at plot scale and reduce at finer scale to the favour of limiting similarity into driving trait-based assembly
  - only marginal influence of environmental gradients
  
@speisserNumberSimultaneouslyActing2022
- AIM: to experimentally test the effect of multiple global change factors (0, 1, 2, 4, 6) on sown & transplanted-seedling communities
- Productivity
  - *Single factor: (+) eutrophication & (-) salinization & microplastic
  - Multiple factor increase
    - (+)* biomass transplanted -> dependent on ID of factors & specific pairwise interactions
    - sown NS
- Community composition
  - Single factor
    - NS transplanted community
    - sown: *affected by microplastic, salinisation & warming (PC1) & eutrophication (PC2)
  - Multiple factor increase: *affected both transplanted & sown communities (PC2)
    - best explained by pairwise interactions model for transplanted
    - best explained by ID model for sown
- Community diversity
  - Single factor: NS for transplanted and/or sown
  - Multiple factor increase: *decrease both transplanted & sown Shannon & evenness
    - best explained by pairwise interactions model for transplanted Shannon & evenness
    - best explained by ID model for Shannon sown & null model for evenness
- TAKE-HOME
  - increase of number of global change factors systematically decreased plant diversity & affected plant community, but not productivity of sown communities
  - shift in towards more productive community under eutrophication
  - stronger ecological effects when multiple GCFs act simultaneously instead of individually

@ngDisentanglingEffectsFarmland2018
- AIM: to assess how ground beetle morphological traits vary between woodlands & adjacent farmland uses and how the effect depend on distance from the edge
- 4 dimensions of trait variation: decreasing body size; diet; increasing robustness; increasing visual ability
- Only body size responded to interaction between farmland use & distance
  - smaller species associated with interior (200 m) woodland whichever adjoining plantings & near edges (20 m) woodland when adjoining plants & fallow
  - larger species associated with interior (200 m) fallows & crops, near edges (20 m) fallows & plantings & edges woodland-fallow & woodland-woody debris
- Role of vegetation structure
  - body size negatively related to litter cover but positively related to bare ground cover & total herbaceous cover
  - diet positively related to vegetation height but negatively associated with total herbaceous cover
  - robustness negatively associated with bare ground cover
  - visual ability negatively associated with litter cover but positively associated with vegetation height
  - wingless & reduced wings associated with increased vegetation height & decreased litter cover, while winged beetles were associated with bare ground & total herbaceous cover while decreasing with litter cover
- TAKE-HOME: 
  - beetle body size sensitive to vegetation structure and farmland use x distance interaction
  - body size, diet, robustness, visual ability and wing morphology sensitive to vegetation structure

@speedResponsePlantDiversity2013
- AIM: to investigate the effect of grazing intensity (0, 0.25 & 0.8 ind/ha) on alpha diversity, temporal beta diversity (community stability) & spatial beta diversity (community homogenisation) in a 10y experiment along an elevational gradient in Norway (1050-1320 masl)
- Species richness
  - best model explanation variation includes: single effects elevation, vegetation type & grazing + interaction elevation x grazing & vegetation type & grazing
  - increased with elevation in decreasing grazing intensity across all functional groups
  - stable when grazing intensity maintained across elevation & functional groups
  - at highest elevations, not much change in species richness across most of the landscape
  - when grazing decreased, species richness decreased at low elevation & increased at high elevation, with threshold depending on vegetation type
- Temporal variance community composition
  - best model explanation community dissimilarity includes: single effects elevation, vegetation type & grazing + interaction elevation x grazing
  - dissimilarity tall herb meadow & graminoid snowbed > dwarf shrub heath > lichen heath
  - strong increase dissimilarity with elevation in decreasing grazing intensity treatments across all functional groups, but stable in maintained & increased grazing intensity
- Spatial variance in community composition
  - no *differences in change in total beta diversity between grazing treatments in either heathlands or grasslands
  - spatial turnover decreased grazing >* maintained grazing in heathland
  - community nestedness decreased grazing <* maintained grazing in heathland
- TAKE-HOME: single & interaction influence of grazing & elevation on plant species richness & temporal stability community composition

@rahbekRoleSpatialScale2005
- AIM: to discuss scale effect (extent, grain) on species richness in relation with altitudinal gradient
- Extent: 
  - when data covers the entire gradient, more tendency towards hump-shaped than monotonic relationship
  - only at smallest extent that monotonic dominates
- Grain: patterns with coarse 

@nogues-bravoScaleEffectsHuman2008
- AIM: to test scale effect (extent + grain) on species richness relationship with altitudinal gradient
- distribution species richness along altitudinal gradient varies according to extent

  - monotonically decreasing pattern with diminishing extent, more visible when lower limit excluded
- No substantial effect of grain size
- Fitness of statistical model varies according to spatial extent
  - M1 - monotonic species-richness-productivity model, where SR decreases with altitude -> best when smaller extent
  - M2 - monotonic species-richness-area model, where SR decreases with altitude -> best when smaller extent 
  - M3 - hump-shaped species richness-productivity model, where productivity decreases with altitude while SR peak in lower half -> best when full extent

- Environmental sets: regional scale, landscape scale (intensity + green veining), local -> hierarchical partitioning community variation
- Pooled taxa
  - landscape scale factors explained most variability compared with local
  - 1st gradient ~20% variability: green veining-land use intensity
  - 2nd gradient ~17% variability: pure green veining from high connectivity to high landscape diversity
- Differentiated taxa
  - Overall similar dependence on environmental factors: landscape LUI > green veining > habitat
  - Within LUI: 
    - for Apoidae, Araneae & Heteroptera: spatial (% cover) >>* stress (e.g. pesticides)
    - For Carabidae & Syrphidae: spatial ~ stress
  - Within green veining - marginal differences between subsets overall taxa
    - for Apoidae, Araneae & Heteroptera: configuration > diversity > composition
    - for Carabidae: configuration > composition > diversity
    - for Syrphidae: composition > configuration > diversity
  - Within habitat: same trend for all taxa - composition >>* diversity
- Size classes: 
  - explained variation green veining > LUI > habitat
  - within green veining, most important configuration
  - within LUI, most important stress
  - 1st gradient ~63% variation: high-low connectivity, with size arthropod increase with decreasing connectivity
  - 2nd gradient ~30% variation LUI: medium-size arthropods associated with low levels of LUI & small & large to high levels
- Trophic guilds:
  - explained variation more evenly distributed between sets environmental variables, even if still green veining > LUI > habitat
  - within green veining, configuration most important
  - within LUI, spatial most important
  - 1st gradient 58% variation from high to low connectivity -> saprophagous associated with high level connectivity
  - 2nd gradient 38% variation LUI dominated by crop diversity -> omnivorous associated with high LUI level
- TAKE-HOME: habitat connectivity in the landscape as the most crucial factors all taxa considered, compared with strictly associated land use intensity & habitat

@carmonaTaxonomicalFunctionalDiversity2012
- AIM: to test influence of grazing intensity, habitat type & rainfall on taxonomic & functional diversities
- Grazing intensity: abandonment; occasional; permanent; concentration (high)
- Habitat type: wet with deep soils, water & nutrient inflows; dry with shallow soils & nutrient & water outflows
- Response of alpha taxonomic & functional diversities to grazing habitat-dependent 
  -> increase grazing intensity in drier, more restricted conditions, consistently reduced taxonomic diversity
  -> functional diversity more stable, but still negatively affected by very high grazing pressure when water availability severely limited

- Management: 
  - richness extensive specialist leaf-beetles >* intensive
  - all other richness & abundance NS
- Landscape:
  - all generalist & specialist but specialist carabid richness negatively related to % cover grassland (positively to complexity)
  - all generalist abundance negatively related to % cover grassland, no effect specialist
- At species level, overall more species affected by landscape rather than management

- AIM: to assess species richness of plants, butterflies, carabids, rove beetles & spiders according to habitat (cereal fields, mixed fodder/crop, semi-natural pastures), management (organic vs conventional) & landscape complexity
- METHOD - for spiders, no diversity but *sequential counting index* to address identification issues -> species switches frequency in petri dish
- METHOD - *warning big rarefication of individuals*
- species richness butterflies & carabids positively correlated, no relationships for other
- interaction effect landscape x field management -> butterflies & carabids relate to landscape only on "conventional" farms, no effect on organic farms.
  - butterfly diversity positively correlated to both large-scale & small-scale heterogeneity
  - carabids diversity positively correlated to small-scale heterogeneity
- in pastures, positive correlation between number of carabids & rove beetle species

@weibullSpeciesCompositionAgroecosystems2003
- AIM: to compare species composition of plants, butterflies & carabids according to habitat (cereal fields, mixed fodder/crop, semi-natural pastures), management (organic vs conventional) & landscape complexity
- METHOD - landscape heterogeneity across 3 scales
  - "large-scale heterogeneity" encompassing multiple farms (25 km^2^ square)
    - Shannon habitat diversity index
  - "small-scale heterogeneity" for individual farms (400 x 400 m)
    - Shannon habitat diversity index
    - percent cover of selected habitat type
  - "field heterogeneity" at scale of multiple fields (400 m radius)
    - Shannon crop diversity index
- About 15-20% variation in species composition explained by all three factor classes -> relatively low
- different taxa associated with different landscape features
  - butterflies to % mixed fodder/crop on farm
  - carabids to farm management & small-scale landscape heterogeneity
  - plants at field boundaries to % mixed fodder/crop on farm

@hopcraftHerbivoresResourcesRisks2010
- AIM: to reflect on conceptual model on how underlying environmental gradients influence both top-down & bottom-up native herbivore regulation -> based on savannah systems
- digestible quality of primary production inversely related to rainfall -> high rainfall & fertility means no limiting factors and thus more potential for plants to redirect resources towards defensive strategies against herbivores -> wetter environment means less efficient energy & nutrient uptake per unit biomass

@dorroughPlantNeighbourhoodLandscape2007
- AIM: to explore grazing x scale interactions on plant species richness and coexistence with sheep grazing in Australia
  - at fine scale and when resources non-limiting, moderate to heavy grazing should reduce competition & increase colonisation and richness. Decline expected when resources more limiting
  - at broad scale, independently of resource supply, richness predicted to decline due to loss of grazing intolerant species
- Method: 5 scales (0.0011 m^2^, 0.001 m^2^, 0.11 m^2^, 10.8 m^2^, 390 m^2^), 3 grazing regimes (light, moderate, heavy) & 3 landscape positions (lower, mid, upper) -> heavy grazing on upper slopes only, no inclusion mid
- Sampling design to assess scale effect: modified fractal sampling Sierpinski triangle
- Resource availability
  - correlation phosphorous, mineral nitrogen, organic carbon & total nitrogen
  - high total & available nutrient concentrations associated either with light & moderate grazing on lower slopes, or with heavy grazing on upper slopes
- Vegetation structure
  - vegetation stature declined*** with grazing intensity and was consistently lower* on upper slopes compared with lower slopes, even if difference mainly driven by high intensity on upper slopes
  - vegetation heterogeneity mostly varied according to extremes: very high on lower slopes with light grazing intensity, very low on upper slopes with high grazing intensity
- Plant species richness
  - consistent response*** of native plant species richness to grazing across scales -> heavy < moderate < light
  - for both native & exotic, no difference between moderate & heavy at lower scales (0.0011 & 0.01)
  - response to topography location scale-dependent: 
    - all plant richness lower ~ upper slope at lower scales (0.0011 & 0.01)
    - lower < upper at 0.11 and above

@birkhoferGeneralRelationshipsAbiotic2012
- AIM: to assess influence of soil properties in driving abundance & diversity of soil biota against location and land-use type in grasslands & forests in Germany
- individual drivers (location, land-use type & soil properties) significant to explain both abundance and diversity of soil biota if analysed separately
- location + land-use type -> more than 58% of variation for abundance & 33% of variation for diversity, but soil properties still significant once the two previous are removed
- soil fauna abundance significantly related to soil properties independently of location or land-use type -> mites & to lesser extent collembola most abundant in acidic soils with low nitrate concentration
- soil fauna diversity significantly related to soil properties independently of location and land-use type, but mainly driven by myriapodes

@lundholmPlantSpeciesDiversity2009
- AIM: review to investigate plant species diversity in relation to environmental heterogeneity across different scales from both observational & experimental studies
- 3 assumptions required for positive heterogeneity-diversity relationships (HDR)
  - factors defining species niches must be heterogeneous at scales that could alter individual plant responses and community-level patterns
  - interspecific variation in dispersal abilities does not interfere - all fitted species can reach available microsites
  - each individual occupies a patch perceived as homogeneous -> difference between coarse-grained (bigger scale than individual spatial extent) which promotes diversity, and fine-grained (smaller than individual spatial extent) heterogeneity which can provoke different responses
- most observational studies (34/41) reported positive HDR -> only species richness as a measure of diversity except for 4 studies
- common predictors of diversity - heterogeneity of topography, substrate & soil type
  - response to soil nutrient heterogeneity either positive or neutral
  - response to topographic heterogeneity under 200 m^2^ either negative or NS, more often positive above 600 m^2^
- no evidence of spatial scale "threshold" above which HDR become positive
- no noticeable relationship between focal scale & shape/magnitude of HDR across experimental studies
- competing hypothesis - available energy hypothesis
- TAKE-HOME: most studies support positive HDR, confirming niche importance & strength compared with neutral distribution patterns, but relationship not universal nor homogeneous

@habelEuropeanGrasslandEcosystems2013
- High-species richness in grassland explained by a combination of factors across scales. Respectively: large evolutionary species pool; intermediate position along environmental gradient; landscape heterogeneity/mass effect; continuity of habitat patches in space and time; reduction of competitive exclusion.
- Need to consider different taxa, functional groups, scales of drivers when assessing management effect on grassland biodiversity.

@zelnikPlantSpeciesDiversity2013
- AIM: Survey plant richness & composition x abiotic factors in wet Molinia grasslands
- plant species richness in Central European meadows was first determined by soil factors, then climatic, then topographic and finally management.
- floristic composition variance best explained by altitude (60-680 masl), pH, flooding frequency, mean annual temperature, date of mowing, humidity, annual precipitation, available P and total N

@siefertScaleDependenceVegetationenvironment2012
- edaphic variables with highest overall primacy across scale -> the most likely to explain the most variation in plant community composition

@turtureanuScaleTaxondependentBiodiversity2014
- AIM: assess plant diversity according to scale and 4 predictors (soil, topography, climate, land-use)
- Relative importance of predictors different according to scales: at very fine (0.0001-0.01 m^2^) humus content, microrelief & land-use at bigger scales (from 0.1 to 100 m^2^)
- Other significant factors, but not for whole range: heat load index, litter cover & altitude (200-700 masl)
- At 10 m^2^:
  -	vascular species richness negatively affected by heat load index, micro-relief, clay content, temperature annual range & management type
  -	bryophyte species richness negatively affected by heat load index & humus content, positively affected by stone cover
  -	lichen species richness positively affected by humus content & minimum temperature of coldest month, unimodal response to microrelief

@zulkaSpeciesRichnessDry2014
- AIM: assess plant & arthropod diversity according to patch size, isolation or habitat quality
  -	Historical patch size stronger predictor than current one
  -	None of patch quality measures significant predictor for total grassland species richness, but species richness including all species positively affected by % agricultural matrix & patch heterogeneity
  -	Specialist richness increased with amount of extensively used landscape elements
  -	All species richness (specialists, all grassland, all species) negatively affected by increasing distance to next large grassland area
  -	All taxa combined, grassland specialists mostly driven by aboveground standing phytomass April, gravel content & area if short-grass dry grassland (landscape)

@gonthierBiodiversityConservationAgriculture2014
- AIM: quantitative review to compare impacts of localized management strategies against landscape complexity drivers on richness & abundance of plant, invertebrate & vertebrate species
- Both local and landscape drivers affected species richness, but differed according to taxonomic group
- Overall richness higher in low-intensity farming compared to high-intensity farming
  - plant & invertebrate richness significantly higher in low-intensity, but vertebrates not affected
  - plant richness responded more strongly to local management intensification than invertebrate & vertebrate
- Landscape complexity x richness
  - no significant mean correlation between plant richness
  - both invertebrate & vertebrate richness with significantly mean correlation
- Abundance
  - overall abundance higher in low-intensity farming, but by group only invertebrate significant
  - overall abundance also higher with landscape complexity, but by group again only invertebrate significant

  - mixed-grass prairie: nutrient availability
  - short-grass steppe: all abiotic (no specific best predictor)
- magnitude ANPP response to nutrient: significant effect* of N+ & P+ on all three sites but no difference between sites & year
- Species-specific absolute responses
  - no significant response at the individual species' scale but effect when considered as classes different in each site
  - mesic tallgrass prairie: strongest response of dominant grasses to all nutrients N+, P+, K+, N+P+K
  - intermediate mixed-grass prairie: strongest response of dominant grasses to N+ & K+
  - short-grass steppe: response dominant grass to N+ & P+ > dominant forbs, response rare grass & forbs to K+ > dominant grass & forbs

## FJORD EFFECT

@fridleyLongerGrowingSeasons2016
- AIM: to investigate the response of plant functional traits to warming & rainfall manipulations in species-rich grassland with shallow & deep soils in northern England
- Ordination trait x treatment
  - 1st axis showing short to tall species, with latter showing higher maximum carbon assimilation rate, larger & tougher leaves -> correlated with warming & deeper soils
  - 2nd axis reflecting leaf-tissue investment & seed mass -> associated with variation in summer rainfall
- Trait explanatory power:
  - least informative: specific lead area & leaf dry matter content
  - most informative: canopy height, leaf-tissue investment & seed mass
- Soil depth: temperature effect on canopy height 3x higher in deep soil compared with shallow soil
- Association species traits x climate responses
  - drought decreases seed mass & increase leaf investment consistently across soil depth
  - heat increased canopy height independently from soil depth, but reduced leaf investment & seed mass only visibly in deep soils
- Standing biomass:
  - heated >(0.1) control
  - control >* drought
  - watered NS control
  - deep >** shallow
- TAKE-HOME: strong associations between functional traits & temperature regime, mediated by soil depth

@guoSpatialVariationsAboveground2012
- AIM: assess relationship between steppe grassland productivity and precipitation along Eurasian climate gradient (**! gradient only up to 500 mm/year**)
- exponential relationship ANPP x mean annual precipitation along the whole gradient desert steppe - typical steppe - meadow steppe
- for individual steppe type, linear relationship with slope meadow >> typical >> desert
- contribution to spatial variation of ANPP:
  - mean annual precipitation: meadow (36%) ~ desert (35%) > typical (15%)
  - precipitation seasonal distribution: typical (36%) > desert (9%) > meadow (4%)
- TAKE-HOME: ANPP more sensitive to annual precipitation changes in wet environment & annual precipitation more important than seasonal distribution to explain spatial variation in ANPP in wet environment

@klanderudImportanceBioticVs2015
- AIM: to assess the relative importance of biotic (functional group cover) & abiotic (pH, moisture, SOM) factors on plant community composition along environmental gradient (346-1208 masl) in Western Norway (Vigdis transplant experiment)
- Main underlying gradients CCA: temperature & precipitation
- Functional groups
  - precipitation (+) graminoids & (-) forbs
  - bryophyte (-) forb species richness
  - temperature + precipitation (+) bryophyte & LOI
- Regional variation graminoid & forb: vegetation height, soil moisture & pH most important variables
- Local variation graminoid & forb: low explanatory power all environment variables -> either no effect or contradictory effects between sites
  - explanatory power individual local biotic variables increases (even if NS) consistently in response to temperature while abiotic variables not as straightforward
  -> relative role of local biotic & abiotic environmental variables shifts along the broad scale climate gradients, with increased weight of biotic variables in warmer sites
  - interaction with precipitation: biotic variables explained more towards wetter climate in subalpine & boreal zones, but more towards drier climates in colder alpine

@olsenFacilitationCompetitionTemperature2016
- AIM: to assess the effect of temperature & precipitation on biotic interactions between dominant plant functional group (graminoid) & subordinate species (forbs) - Vigdis
- Temperature effect: difference in population growth rate with/without graminoids *increased with temperature
  - alpine: growth rates decreased in removal compared with control -> facilitation
  - boreal: growth rates consistently increased with removal -> competition
- Precipitation effects: no systematic variation in the effect of dominant removal along precipitation gradient
- TAKE-HOME: temperature affects biotic interaction from facilitation (cold) to competition (warm)

@michaletzDriversTerrestrialPlant2018
- AIM: review/perspective arguing towards the dominance of indirect influence of climate on global variation of NPP compared with direct (kinetics) effects
- >60y research showing that plant functional traits better predictors of NPP than climate & latitude
- recent analysis showing that effects of biomass & age on NPP much stronger than climate

@maGlobalDistributionEnvironmental2021
- AIM: to map global distribution of root-mass fractions (index plant belowground vs AGB) in trees, shrubs & grasses
- Global distribution:
  - high RMF in cold & dry
  - low RMF in warm & wet
- Average habitat RMF: grassland (67%) > shrubland (47%) > forest (22%)
- Environmental control: 
  - across all vegetation types, temperature & water availability as dominant drivers at global scale but important interactive effects
    - shrubland: negative effect of temperature strongly increases towards moister regions
    - grassland: negative effect soil moisture higher at intermediate temperature levels & negative effect temperature higher at dry locations
  - sand content, depth bedrock & soil C:N also important

@knappReconcilingInconsistenciesPrecipitation2017
- AIM: review on recent evidence showing inconsistencies on linear precipitation-ANPP relationship & suggestion non-linear model
- Double asymmetry model
  - positive asymmetry (slight concave-up) under conditions of nominal (baseline) precipitation variability
  - negative asymmetry (strong concave-down) when extended to extreme precipitation years
-> Implication: precipitation threshold for ANPP saturation? Max ANPP with no water limitation? Precipitation level beyond which ANPP declines?

@knappRainfallVariabilityCarbon2002
- AIM: to assess the response of mesic grassland plant & soil to variation in rainfall in 4y experiments
- Independently on rain amount, increase in variability of rainfall negatively affected ANPP & ANPP was more sensitive to moisture (rainfall) than soil water content

@mysterudEffectsDensitySeason2007

- Prediction: increased used of higher elevation as new, high quality forage emerge according to the Ideal-free distribution (IFD) hypothesis (more even use of habitats at higher density)
- Sheep used whole gradient across the whole summer grazing season
- Hyp validation: 
  - lower elevations used more often early season than late
- Hyp contradiction:
  - no density effect on the use of elevation gradient
  - decline in average elevation towards end season
- Strong effect prevailing weather: higher elevation more during warm weather

@ketzlerClimateNorway2021
- AIM: chapter from book on geomorphological features of Norway [@beylichLandscapesLandformsNorway2021], focusing on climate
- "as Norway is located in the zone of westerly winds, the increase in elevation along the Norwegian coast forces the rise of moist air masses" -> higher cloudiness & precipitations on the coast
- Gulf stream provides both warmer currents & buffers annual temperature range
  - summer: temperature ocean > air -> higher evaporation rate which creates moist air masses
  - winter: temperature ocean < air
- combined effect of distance to sea, elevation and geographical location
- precipitation gradient coast-inland 
  -> peak of precipitation on western zones "in front of" Scandinavian mountains (e.g. Brekke at outer Sognefjord) or lower mountain areas inland (< 1400 m)
  - high variation range in mountain and inland areas
- the coast
  - "numerous islands, inlets and peninsulas at different sizes and, thus, land and water next to each other in different scales and in combination with different relief situations."
  - sea breeze effect - rising warm air from ground collides with cooler sea air that moves horizontally (advected) inland -> temporary changes of wind direction & humidity conditions
  - reflection of sunlight on water with increased radiation input on waterfront
  - reduced/amplified cooling by surrounding warm/cold water bodies
  - reduced land-sea differences with windy conditions or combined sea & mountain breezes
- the fjord
  - "U-shaped valleys partly below sea level" -> differences between outer fjord and inner fjord
  - inner fjord regions
    - "Föhn wind" effect (dry, relatively warm descending leewards - usually protected - mountain slopes)
    - but overall low wind speed
    - mild climate, with winter mostly >0C, high spring temp, moderate summer temp -> fruit cultivation
    - inland freshwater fjords -> frozen surface in winter react like land areas
    - great lakes -> local climate effects (buffer daily temperature cycle, increase humidity, sea breeze circulation)

@howeFjordSystemsArchives2010
- AIM review of fjord system characteristics across the world
- Fjord definition: "steep-sided, coastal erosional troughs which have been inundated by the sea", originating from "topographic steering of ice sheets".
- "Historically, fjords have provided a sheltered, fertile place for communities since at least the early Neolithic, allowing easy access to good farming, fishing and a mode of transport between isolated people"

@austrheimPlantDiversityPatterns2002
- AIM: observational study to compare diversity of plant functional types along an elevational gradient in southern Norway -> 4 levels L1 500-550; L2 735-775; L3 895-960; L4 1150-1260
- Q1 - What are the main patterns of species diversity (alpha, beta, gamma) in vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens along the gradient?
  - vascular plants
    - gamma - total vascular species richness decreased with elevation at both 10 m^2^ & 500 m^2^ scales
    - alpha - significant peak at elevation L2 at quadrat (0.25 m^2^) scale, but no significant relationship richness x elevation
    - low relative contribution of alpine species at L1 & L2, while high contribution of lowland/subalpine species at L3 & L4
    - similarity highest at L2 & L3, higher number of exclusive species at L1 & L4
  - bryophytes & lichens
    - gamma - increase with elevation at 10 m^2^ scale (except for L2)
    - alpha - significant increase with elevation at quadrat & subquadrat scales (0.0156 m^2^)
    - similarity highest at L3 & lowest at L4; higher number of exclusive species at L4
- Q2 - Can patterns of species richness within and among levels be explained by environmental variables?
  - vascular plants species richness
    - decreased with potassium, cryptogam layer cover, phosphorus
    - increased with slope, field layer cover, herb biomass
    - negative linear relationship with PC1 (positively correlated with nutrients, LOI, bryophyte & lichen cover)
    - positively but NS related to PC2 (positively correlated with slope, pH & Ca)
  - bryophytes & lichens species richness
    - decreased with soil temperature, herb & total biomass, percent open surface, field layer cover, slope and heat index
    - increased with LOI, percent cryptogam layer cover, wood biomass
    - strong positive relationship to PC1, indifferent to PC2
- Q3 - Can vascular plant species richness be explained as an area effect?
  - continuous gamma diversity decrease along elevation vs no trend at small scale -> relative importance of area changes with elevation
  - lower estimated marginal mean at L3 compared to L1 & L2, at L4 compared to L2
  
@kleinebeckerEffectsGrazingSeasonal2011
- AIM: observational study of seasonal effect on floristic composition, abiotic soil properties & AGB chemical composition in calcareous grassland in Germany
  - Q1 - which factors determine the species composition?
    - significant gradient driven by nitrate, phosphorus, water content, potassium & yield
  - Q2 - what are the effects of abiotic site conditions, seasonal variation, and grazing by sheep on biomass quality?
    - abiotic: difference in nutrient composition between slope site & plateau site, but not reflected in biomass chemistry rates, though harvested biomass yield higher implying higher amount of nutrients stored
    - seasonal dynamics: 
      - clear declining trend of nitrate from May to August on plateau site only, no trend for P & K
      - nutrient concentrations in AGB declined from May to July & increased again in August (ordination results)
    - grazing: 
      - decline of N, P & K after 1st grazing event in May but recovery in August
      - increase of neutral detergent fibre after grazing & decline in August (opposite N)
      - decrease metabolizable energy after grazing event, with only slight increase afterwards

@habelEuropeanGrasslandEcosystems2013
- Topographic wetness index negatively affected primary producers

@klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007
- elevation, slope angle and solar radiation significant driver of plant species composition in grasslands
- sites with high soil quality opposed to those with higher slope angles
  - Frequencies of *Cardamine pratensis* & *Alopecurus pratensis* correlated with high soil quality
  - Higher frequencies of *Poa pratensis*, *Dactylis glomerata* and *Festuca pratensis* on steeper sites
- second gradient elevation - solar radiation
  - *Trifolium dubium* and *Poa angustifolia* occurred more on sites at low elevation or relatively high solar radiation
  - *Heracleum sphondylium* and *Agrostis capillaris* occurred more on sites at higher elevation or with low solar radiation

  - Carabids good indicators for hoverflies
  - Bees good indicators for herbs
- For all taxa, variables describing land use intensity & landscape structure significant drivers of species richness variation
  - Total vascular species increased with area of semi-natural habitats & decreased with heavily fertilized area -> driven by herbaceous species
  - Same for birds
  - Combined richness of arthropods increased with area of semi-natural habitats & with crop diversity
  - Only bee richness increased with diversity of semi-natural habitat types

@cousinsModellingEffectsLandscape2003
- AIM: to model the effect of grazing and landscape at 3 time periods (17th-18th; 19740s; current) on simulated plant functional groups & successional dynamics in semi-natural grasslands with the LAndscape MOdelling Shell (LAMOS) platform
- PFGs:
  - A: grazing-tolerant biennial with good dispersal but poor competition
  - B: grazing-tolerant short-lived perennial with poor dispersal & competition
  - C: grazing-tolerant long-lived perennial with poor dispersal & slightly better competition
  - D: grazing intolerant long-lived perennial with good dispersal
  - E: grazing intolerant very long-lived perennial
- Historical landscape patterns
  - reduction grassland area 59% (200-300y) to 11% (present): sharp decrease A & decrease B & C abundance
  - reduction grassland area 59% (200-300y) to 31% (1940s): equal decrease A, B & C abundance
- Grazing intensity & frequency
  - decrease 100% to 20%: low effect on A, B, C biomass
  - below 20% threshold: drop all three, particularly A, and increase D & E
  - aggravating effects of decrease of both grazing intensity & frequency
- TAKE-HOME:
  - grazing-tolerant plant abundance decreased with decline grassland area in the landscape
  - grazing intensity threshold ~20% under which shift of dominance with drop of grazing-tolerant, particularly biennial

  - NS plant species richness & depth organic horizon in soil
- Dominance: agricultural system more even, forest system less even but with more rare species
- Community
  - distributed along the forest-open gradient, but still distinct communities for the two forest dominated areas
  - *environmental parameters both years: canopy density (eigen 0.1-0.14) > plant species richness (0.06-0.07) > birch spp. cover (0.04-0.05) > mull soil (0.02-0.03) > soil moisture (0.02)

- AIM: to assess the effect of landscape composition & structure on alpha & beta diversity of soil protists in western Swiss Alps meadows
- Spatial scale: 
  - 100 to 200 m radius neighbourhood window: variation explained by local environment > landscape
  - 500 to 2000 m radius: variation explained by landscape > local environment
- Landscape descriptor importance:
  1. % open habitat & % meadow
  2. edge density, homogeneity, average size meadow patches & % forest
  3. intermixing meadows within other habitat classes, clumpiness & % artificial habitat
  4. complexity sampling patch, core area index & sampling area size

- TAKE-HOME:
  - landscape more important factor than local environment on soil protist diversity when including neighbouring habitats beyond 500 m radius
  - landscape composition most important to drive both alpha & beta diversity

- AIM: to assess how habitat amount & area affect orthopteran assemblages & morphological traits in calcareous grasslands
- Species richness & abundance all species (+)* with habitat area & amount
- Species richness both specialists & generalists (+)* with habitat area & amount, with specialist steeper (but NS)
- Intraspecific trait variation:
  - body size increased with habitat size & amount -> increase fitness investment

@janisovaLandscapeEffectsDiversity2014
- AIM: to assess how landscape structure affect vascular plant species alpha, beta & gamma diversity in semi-natural grasslands
- Alpha div: increased with % & diversity natural & semi-natural habitats (+ best predictor) in plot neigbourhood
- Beta div increased with % & diversity non-natural habitats
- Neighbourhood habitat x grassland type
  - % forest: spillover to meso > wet & subxero > xero
  - % non-natural habitat: 
    - spillover to meso > xero > subxero
    - high but stable % non-natural species in wet despite increase % neighbourhood habitat
- TAKE-HOME: 
  - grassland types differently affected by species spillover
  - opposing trends between alpha and beta & gamma div

@grashof-bokdamGreenVeiningLandscape2005
- AIM: review on the effect of green veining in European agricultural landscapes on aboveground biodiversity
- Summary per taxa
  - plants, butterflies & spiders x patch area: saturating (+)
  - arthropods x patch isolation: linear (-)
  - farmland birds x % farm wood: linear (+)
  - farmland birds x hedgerow density: hump-shaped
  - woodland birds x % woodland: saturating (+)
- Research focus
  - taxa: plants (17) > arthropods (15) > birds (6) > mammals (2)
  - response variable: species richness (33) > diversity (10) > composition (4) > nature value (3)
  - explanatory variable: local management (19) > local spatial configuration (13) > farm/landscape area (9) > landscape management (8) > local area (5) & landscape spatial configuration (5)
- TAKE-HOME:
  - does biodiversity of green veining follow species-area relation -> trend (+), but too few quantitative studies to assert
  - can increased connectivity or decreasing management intensity lower needed amount of green veining -> relationship management x connectivity not straightforward + lack of definition intensity
  - lack of research on spatial configuration compared with intensity + hard to disentangle both as high connectivity usually linked with low intensity farming
  - research perspectives: species indicator group for specific landscape + modelling efforts necessary to handle landscape scale

@evjuSpatialConfigurationMatters2016
- AIM: to test habitat amount hypothesis (whether total amount in landscape can compensate patch size & isolation) on dry calcareous grasslands in South-Eastern Norway
- Scale effect on vascular species richness x habitat amount: stable 0.5-3 km radius & linearly decline from 4 km
- Habitat configuration
  - model 1: habitat amount within 3 km radius; patch size; interaction -> best model with habitat amount & patch size, with explanatory power 6x better when including patch size compared with habitat amount only
  - model 2: habitat amount; distance nearest patch; interaction -> best model habitat amount only, at least 2.5x better than others
- TAKE-HOME: 
  - vascular plant species richness of dry calcareous grasslands increase with habitat amount in the landscape up to 3 km radius
  - habitat amount does not compensate entirely for patch size

  - all feeding guilds positively affected by % historically preserved species rich grassland in landscape either independently or with interaction
  - herbivory & grassland specialism favoured by grassland age, similarity to target grasslands but declined under high cutting frequency

@martelImpactFarmingSystems2019
- AIM: to assess the impact of livestock management & farmer's decision making on crop habitat & ground beetles in agricultural landscapes
- Models: maize vs woody species for carabid abundance & crop allocation in farming systems "dairy" & "swine" in open and dense landscape units
- Effect of farming systems on cropping plant
  - same trend open & dense landscape: transition from swine to dairy led to decrease winter crop areas & increase grassland areas
  - lower increase grassland percentage, smaller field size & higher field number in dense landscape compared with open
- Carabid abundance when increasing number dairy farms & % surface area in dairy production
  - woody species: tend to decrease in dense landscape (12 to 10), but tend to increase in open landscape (4 to 6)
  - maize species: sharp decrease in open landscape (700 to 200), slow decrease in dense landscape (200 to 150)
- Farm contribution to variation of maize beetles
  - *dense landscape: length of variable edges & variable edge length between 2 fields of the farm
  - *open landscape: average value 20th, mean & 80th percentile of grassland area
- TAKE-HOME: maize species more abundant in open swine landscape while woody species more abundant in mixed landscapes

@dauberLandscapeStructureIndicator2003
- AIM: to assess influence of patch variable & landscape matrix (% land use) on species richness of ants, wild bees & vascular plants at two spatial scales (50 m & 200 m radius)
- no correlation between species richness of the three taxa
  - vascular plants: aspect (+) South > soil type (+) humid, no influence matrix
  - ants: (+) % forest (only 50 m radius) > (+) fallow land (both scales), no influence patch variables
- wild bees: soil type (+) dry > (+) patch age > (+) % arable land (all both scales)

@burelComparativeBiodiversityGradient1998
- AIM: to compare diversity & similarity (Sørensen) of small mammals, birds, insects & plants across a landscape intensification gradient
- no obvious effect of landscape intensification on carabid diversity [**warning no statistical test**]
- if carabid species change, most important phenomenon is species replacement

@burelDifferentialResponseSelected2004
- AIM: to compare community similarity (Sørensen & Squirres) of small mammals, chironomids (Diptera) & Carabids between two extremes of a landscape intensification & homogenisation gradient
- communities with low evenness more sensitive to intensification
- carabid community affected by landscape matrix
  - temporally stable landscape favoured large carabids
  - in both intensification (cereal crops associated with agroindustry) & homogenisation (maize crops associated with milk production) decrease of relative abundance large carabids against small, mobile and more ubiquitous species

@jeanneretQuantifyingImpactLandscape2003
- AIM: to assess influence of plant sp richness, habitat type & landscape composition/structure on spider, carabid & butterflies assemblages in agricultural landscape
- METHOD - habitat type = meadows at different intensity (high, extensive, low), hedgerow, orchard, forest edge
- METHOD - landscape characteristics
  - variability = number surrounding land use types
  - heterogeneity = number of patches of different land use types
  - index of landscape pattern using dominance measure
  - surrounding land use classes
- Variance in taxa assemblage
  - Spider: habitat type > forest > plant species richness
  - Carabids: habitat type > plant species richness > cultivated land
  - butterflies: plant species richness > ecological conservation area > surrounding habitat heterogeneity > forest
- TAKE-HOME: habitat type largely accounted for greater explanation of variance, & plant species richness significant explanatory power for all taxa. However influence of landscape minor.

@jonsenResponseGeneralistSpecialist1997
- AIM: compare species richness & abundance of generalist & specialist weevils & leafhoppers in alfalfa fields according to landscape spatial structure (Shannon habitat diversity + % alfafa cover)
- generalist species richness influenced by habitat diversity (+) > frequency disturbance (-) > field age (+)
- generalist abundance positively related by habitat diversity only

@purtaufCarabidCommunitiesSpatiotemporal2004
- AIM: assess carabid community dynamic in a chronosequence of grasslands at different ages after transition from crops
- more carabid species in grasslands under 10 years old, abundance NS
- migration
  - very high immigration during the first two years
  - most grassland species present after 10 years, with no further immigration after 28 years
  - species loss continued across all age classes
- shift feeding group species dominance from carnivorous/mixophagous in crops to phytophagous in grasslands
- positive correlation plant species richness x abundance & richness phytophagous
- positive correlation ground cover x abundance phytophagous
- **warning - correlations probably linked to high differences between classes, so probably not reproducible with only "pure" grasslands**

- AIM: to assess the influence of different landscape features (% semi-natural habitats & diversity habitat types at different spatial scales from 250-3000 m radius) on richness and abundance of solitary wild bees, honeybees & bumblebees
- up to 750 m radius
  - increase of wild bees richness & abundance with % semi-natural habitats
  - no interaction honeybees & bumblebees with % semi-natural habitats
- across scales
  - amount of variation in solitary wild bee abundance explained by % semi-natural habitats decreased with increasing spatial scale

  - significance landscape context explaining distribution honeybees increased with spatial scale

@dauberLocalVsLandscape2005
- AIM: to assess influence of landscape-scale factors on species richness of arthropod taxa with various mobility in German agricultural landscape
- species richness arthropod depends on land use type x taxa
  - carabid arable > fallow > grassland
  - staphylinid fallow > arable ~ grassland
- beetle families respond differently to environmental drivers
  - variation carabid species richness more linked to land use (~40%) > humidity (~10%) > length forest edge > % cover fallow land
  - variation staphylinids more explained by temperature (~20%) > interaction land use x cover fallow land (~10%) > land use (~10%) > length forest edge

@leprovostContrastingResponsesBelowground2021
- landscape-level land use the most important driver of species richness of both above and belowground trophic groups
- primary producers variance approx. equally explained by plot-level & landscape-level factors, total variance explained by model very high (50%)
- aboveground arthropod (both predators & omnivores) variance mostly explained by landscape-level factors, but total variance explained smaller (~15% for predators, ~10% for omnivores)
- grassland permanency negatively affected primary producers but positively affected arthropods (both predators and omnivores)
- insect herbivores variance best explained by wider landscape (2000 m radius) while primary producers, omnivores & predators arthropods variances were best explained by smaller-scale landscape (500 m radius)
- high land use intensity in surrounding landscape weakens the correlation between trophic groups -> disruption species interactions

@dramstadIntegratingLandscapebasedValues2001
- AIM: explore relationship between landscape and associated values such as biodiversity, cultural heritage & human appreciation through appropriate indicators, based on case-study from Norway
- 3Q programm - initiated by the Norwegian Ministries of Agriculture and Environment in order the monitor changes in the agricultural landscape and to identify effects of policy and measures pertaining to this landscape -> multidisciplinary approach
- biodiversity sampled: breeding birds, vascular plants, butterflies & bumblebees

@seiboldArthropodDeclineGrasslands2019
- AIM: to investigate the 10y evolution of arthropod biomass, abundance & richness across 150 grasslands (& 140 forests) with different land uses & landscapes - Biodiversity Exploratories
- Overall *decrease of gamma div, biomass (67%), abundance (78%) & species richness (34%) in grasslands over time, with consistent trends across trophic guilds (herbivores, myceto-detritivores, omnivores, carnivores)
- Dominance: 
  - abundance decline for both abundant & less abundant species
  - species richness decline mostly for less abundant species
- Magnitude of declines in biomass, abundance & species richness independent of local land-use intensity & changes in plant communities
- Landscape: only composition*, with cover arable fields increased species richness decline, while decline only marginal with increasing cover grassland
- TAKE-HOME:
  - overall arthropod diversity loss in European agricultural landscapes
  - landscape composition mediated species richness decline in grasslands

## FIELD MANAGEMENT EFFECT

@schonbachGrasslandResponsesGrazing2011
- AIM: to compare two management systems with co-existing grazing & hay-making (management), one alternating & one non-alternating (block), & assess the effect of grazing intensity (7 levels) on biomass, growth rate & ground cover

- After 3y:
  - ANPP production unit: no grazing >* grazing, no difference between intensities
  - ANPP grazing plot: no grazing* > very light > light* > light-moderate to heavy >* very heavy
  - ANPP hay-making plot: NS
  - relative growth rate: very heavy & heavy* > moderate to very light > no grazing*
  - end-of-season standing biomass: no grazing* > very light > light* > light-moderate to moderate > heavy > very heavy*

@gaujourFactorsProcessesAffecting2012
- AIM: review on management practices affecting plant biodiversity of permanent grasslands
- Grazing
  - Stocking rate: overall high intensity increase ruderal & competitive strategies in productive sites, while low intensity favors stress-tolerance & forbs
  - Seasonality: mostly no effect even if some benefits from winter grazing, but overall needs more research
  - Livestock: cattle more constrained by plant height than plant secondary metabolites (less selective) while sheep more selective on high quality parts
- Nutrient fertilisation
  - Inorganic N: decreases overall species richness & favour nitrophilous grasses over legumes
  - Inorganic P: greater decrease species richness than N particularly in wet environment
  - Lime: no clear effect, but positive if increase soil pH in acidic sites
  - Organic (manure): favour fodder grasses & umbelliferous species, increase heterogeneity through patchiness & seed transport service

@losvikHayMeadowCommunities1993
- AIM: to describe hay-meadow plant communities in Western Norway with update from @losvikPhytosociologyEcologyOld1988

@losvikPhytosociologyEcologyOld1988
- AIM: to describe plant communities of old hay meadows in Hordaland
- 1. Association Ranunculus repens-Cardamine pratense
  - *best cultivated meadows on smaller farms*
  - relatively high P -> medium amount artificial fertiliser + manure
  - from intensive grazing to no grazing
  - *Holcus lanatus*, characteristics of traditionally managed meadows, usually missing
- 2. Achillea millefolium-Conopodium majus
  - *common on slopes bordering flatter, well-fertilised parts of home-fields*
  - on average lower pH, N & P -> moderatly fertilised
  - LOI & C/N usually higher, & density lower
- 3. Deschampsia cespitosa-Galium saxatile
  - *quite common in marginal sites, often steep slopes, bordering well cultivated fields*
  - low pH, with light to no fertilisation
  - overall reduction grazing activity for past few years
  - constant *Potentilla erecta* & *Galium saxatile*
- 4. Campanula rotundifolia-Conopodium majus
  - *on favourably exposed, often steep hill-sides within home-field areas*

**to continue**

@eyreRelationshipBritishGround2003
- AIM: to assess carabid species pool according to habitat type across GB
- strong correlation species x environment despite high "noise" in the dataset
- Heath as very important driver of species pool distribution -> threat of land use changes

@leprovostContrastingResponsesBelowground2021
- field-level factors (plant community heterogeneity & land use temporal variation) less important drivers but sill significant
- land use intensity negatively affected primary producers diversity & insect herbivores, but omnivores and predators arthropods not significantly affected
- increase plot-level intensity reduce species richness of primary producers

@kohlerChangesSpeciesComposition2005
- AIM: 22 years experiment to assess different management practices on plant species composition in two dry limestone grasslands as an alternative to traditional management, not anymore economically viable
- METHOD: 6 managements - "traditional" yearly July mowing, July mowing every 2 years, July mowing every 5 years, abandonment, annual October mowing, annual controlled burning.
- Species composition: substantial divergence after 13-14 years of treatment
- Species richness in percentage of traditional species richness: 
  - significant effect of area: on one site no clear effect, on the other marked decline on 5 years mowing, burning and abandonment treatments
  - significant effect of time, time x area, time x management, management 6 area x management
- Dominant species cover
  - 4 out of 8 species significantly affected by area
  - 8 out of 16 species significantly affected by management
  - 1 out of 8 species significantly affected by area x management
  - 15 out of 16 species significantly affected by time
  - 6 out of 8 species significantly affected by time x area
  - 10 out of 16 species significantly affected by time x management
  - most affected species are *Bromus erectus*, *Brachypodium pinnatum*, *Trifolium medium*, *Primula veris*
  - *Bromus erectus* rather favoured by yearly and by-yearly mowing
  - *Brachypodium pinnatum* rather favoured by burning, abandonment and 5-years mowing
  - *Trifolium medium* rather favoured by burning, abandonment and 5-years mowing
- TAKE-HOME - management effects
  - overall July mowing every two years closer to traditional annual mowing
  - yearly October mowing similar to traditional mowing only for one site, the most nutrient-poor
  - land abandonment negative for typical limestone grassland species
  - 5-years mowing & burning only beneficial for a few species
  -> mosaic of different management types

@allanInterannualVariationLanduse2014
- AIM: effect of land-use intensity (LUI) & interannual variation on multidiversity
- Negative response of multidiversity under increasing LUI, but not all taxonomic groups were affected equally -> most sensitive were Orthoptera, Araneae, Lepidoptera, plants & lichens species richness; not affected were Diptera, arbuscular mycorrrhizal fungi & bats
- Grazing & mowing looked more important than fertilisation to drive decline in multidiversity
- Interannual changes in LUI beneficial for biodiversity, with higher effect at low mean LUI level in general, but with significant effects for rare species also at intermediate and high LUI level
- Temporal variation of overall LUI better predictor of multidiversity than variation of individual LUI component
- Belowground multidiversity less affected by land-use intensification or interannual variation

### FERTILISATION

@rosOptimalUsePhosphorus2020
- AIM: meta-analysis on the global effect of P fertilisation on grassland yield
- Yield effect: overall ~35%
  - Crop type: mix grass/legume >* grass only
  - P rate*: over 50 kgP/ha > under 25 kgP/ha > between 25 & 50
  - climate: tropical >* temperate
  - mean annual temp: over 10C >* under 10C
- Agronomic efficiency
  - crop type: mix grass/legume >* grass only
  - climate NS
  - soil P status: low status >* high status whichever P rate
- Soil effect
  - P status: under 5 mgP/kg >>* over 5 mgP/kg
  - pH: 5-6 >* under 5 & over 6
  - OM content: 5-10% > under 5%
  - clay content: over 25% >* 10-25% >* under 10%
- TAKE-HOME: phosphorus fertilisation most efficient in mixed grasslands, under warmer climates, for poor-P soils with high organic matter content

@myklestadSoilSiteManagement2004
- AIM: to assess the effect of soil chemistry on plant species composition in unfertilised pastures, artificially fertilised hay meadows and intensively cultivated grasslands in Western Norway
- Driver category
  - soil chemistry *explained 0.27 variation
  - management *explained 0.23 variation
- Individual soil drivers: 
  - (*) P content (0.055) > C:N ratio (0.039) > C content (0.037) > N content (0.036) > Ca content (0.028) > K content (0.027) > marginal cation exchange capacity (0.023)
  - But when excluding most intensive site P NS
  - (NS) Mg, Na & pH
- Species dominance (highest abundance)
  - intensively cultivated grassland: *Achillea millefolium*, *Lolium perenne*, *Poa annua*, *Ranunculus repens*, *Rumex acetosa*, *Trifolium repens*
  - high productivity pasture: *Anthriscus sylvestris*, *Dactylis glomerata*, *Festuca pratensis*, *Poa trivialis*, *Ranunculus repens*, *Stellaria media*
  - meadows: *Achillea millefolium*, *Anthoxanthum odoratum*, *Cerastium fontanum*, *Festuca rubra*, *Holcus lanatus*, *Leontodon autumnalis*, *Leucanthemum vulgare*, *Trifolium repens*
- Correlation between soil chemistry factors & N fertiliser
  - (-) C, C:N, N
  - (+) Ca, Mg, pH
- TAKE-HOME: 
  - **unexpected** N fertiliser associated with increase pH value & decrease N
  - negative correlation pH x C:N: lower decomposition rate can decrease pH if base supply not increased

@koningerManureManagementSoil2021
- AIM: to review how manure fertilisation affect soil biodiversity
- Which factors regulate the direct & indirect effects of farm manures on soil biodiversity & which implications on the fate of manure addition
  - manure type: diversity micro-organisms & organic carbon content depend on source animal
  - application: 
    - superficial application through homogeneous spread more likely to reduce micro-organim concentration because of desiccation
    - subsurface application through injection increases survival & prevent run-offs
    - micro-arthropods responded more to slurry application than type (soil compaction driven by machine)
  - quantity: if quantity exceeds plant requirement, contribute accumulation soluble salts, heavy metal, N & P in soil -> ammonium as main toxicity factor reducing arthropods & collembolans survival & reproduction
  - environmental interactions: high pH effect on nematodes & fungivores -> toxicity extreme acidity or alkalinity
  - soil biodiversity
    - increase N retention in soil by stabilisation soil organic matter & reducing ammonia volatilisation
    - increase carbon stabilisation by stimulating microbiota
- Which practices help to achieve sustainable manure management
  - biodiversity manure fertilised fields > mineral fertilised soils
  - agro-ecological systems with higher control of manure production cycle & distribution
- TAKE-HOME: manure more biodiversity friendly than mineral fertilisers, but still important to emphasize quality & not to exceed plant nutrient requirements that increase toxicity factors

@janecekEffectsLanduseChanges2013
- AIM: to compare the effect of abandonment & fertilisation on plant functional & taxonomic diversity in mown wet meadows
- Model 1 - effect management over time
  - abandonment (-)* species richness, Simpson, FD & functional evenness
  - fertilisation (-)* species richness, Simpson & FD but NS functional evenness
  - interaction management x year overall (-)* taxonomic diversity
- Model 2 - to test if change after 2y linked with site productivity
  - Simpson variation decreased more rapidly on high productivity sites with either abandonment or fertilisation, but decreased even faster with both management
  - Functional evenness only decreased more rapidly on high productivity sites when both abandonment & fertilisation involved
  - species richness & functional richness NS
- Model 3 - same as model 2 but after 5y
  - all taxonomic indicators affected
  - functional diversity still NS
- Dissimilarity between treatments: overall increase with stronger effect on productive meadows
- TAKE-HOME: 
  - overall (-) effect abandonment & fertilisation on both taxonomic & functional diversity
  - treatment effect boosted by site productivity

    - stronger contribution species & spatial asynchrony to stability when no grazing (242%) than with heavy (69%)
- Biodiversity x asynchrony
  - spatial asynchrony strongly (+)* correlated with alpha diversity
  - total asynchrony strongly (+)* correlated with gamma diversity
- TAKE-HOME: scale-dependent effects of grazing on stability, with increase species stability but decrease community stability

@debelloGrazingEffectsSpecies2007
- AIM: to assess the effect of grazing management intensity on species-area relationships (0.1-100 m^2^) along an elevation gradient (256-2051 masl)
- grazing effect on species richness differs according to plot size & climatic gradient
  - climate effect: 
    - 10 x 10 cm to 1 x 1 m : clear increase of species richness from arid to humid habitat
    - 5 x 5 to 10 x 10: increase from arid to mid but seems to reach plateau for more humid
  - grazing intensity effect:
    - 10 x 10 to 1 x 1: species richness favoured by high grazing intensity in moist habitat, low grazing intensity in mid & no grazing in arid
    - 5 x 5 to 10 x 10: species richness rather favoured by high intensity grazing at extremes but low-intensity in-between
- TAKE-HOME: plant richness response to grazing along elevation gradient depends on scale of observation

@parsonsSpatialHeterogeneityGrazing2003
- AIM: review of basic plant-grazer interactions from bite to flock leading to system spatial heterogeneity
- 1. How far can fine scale interactions explain origin of phenomena at larger scales
  - sequential (deterministic) vs random biting
    - at low stocking rate (< 5 LU/ha), intake not affected by grazing regime (enough resources & no competition between grazers)
    - at high stocking rate however
      - if deterministic: same patches grazed at same rate with fixed regrowth window -> progressive decrease of biomass
      - if random: some patches would escape grazing by "chance" & have more recovery time -> increase temporal variation regrowth & biomass availability
  - grazing preferences x vegetation structure
![](illustrations/parsonsSpatialHeterogeneityGrazing2003_GrazingSelectionVGStructure.png)
  - foraging costs
    - costs increase 1) with degree of selectivity & 2) if the the preferred food is less abundant in the vegetation
    - trade-off benefits of eating a given diet component against costs of selecting for it
- 2) Animal responses to potentially prohibitive costs
  - How spatial distribution influence encounter rate
    - if random walk: 
      - encounter rate patch: more smaller patches > fewer larger patches
      - encounter rate food: greater variance with fewer larger patches -> longer periods for both preferred food & no food
    - if targeted walk: for any abundance/cover, probability encountering patch depends on size field of view x grain pattern of aggregation
  - Learning & spatial memory
    - when small searching area both naive & trained animals should be more successful to find preferred food, but variation in memory capacity will have small effect
    - benefits of spatial memory greatest in intermediate searching areas
    - less effect spatial memory in largest searching areas implying limitation
  - Area-concentrated searching within patches: "turning" control efficiency coarse-grained > fine-grained & increase with intra-patch resource density
  - How observed foraging success (closer to random) could mismatch expected success (driven by learning & spatial memory)
    - more difficult to exploit knowledge as patch number increases & seeking minimum distance travel path an effort in itself -> experiments needed to confirm if animal make rational planning or graze closer to at random
    - when revisiting areas, they may respond to spatial patterns of replacement rate of resources -> affected by temporal dynamic of regrowth
    - social interactions between animals creating conflicts
- 3) Foraging as a group & effect on individual foraging
  - Costs & benefits group foraging
    - benefice: shared discovery & vigilance
    - downside: intra-specific competition 
      -> risk of returning to a patch which has been depleted by other animals
      -> can encourage animals to leave prematurely a current patch
    - social behaviour -> preference to graze close to peers rather than going further to preferred patch
  - Scale may affect preferences due to social interaction
    - no grouping effect may be observed under a minimum space per individual
    - hyp: foraging efficiency may decline at large spatial scales because of environmental complexity & constraints of group foraging, but also at small spatial allocations when animals are "forced" into groups
- 4) To what extent do animals come close to achieving the optimal solution
  - Optimal foraging modelled at bite scale -> Shape of regrowth curve & subsequent harvest supply depend on initial patch state (residual after previous bite) & duration regrowth
  - Model outputs
    - sequential or random grazing being as individuals or group would lead to suboptimal combinations of residual patch states & defoliation intervals: low stocking rate with too long defoliation intervals vs higher stocking rate with low residual patch states
    - grouped animals with regulated movements (fencing) & rotation -> possible to combine severe defoliation with long recovery intervals

@koernerChangeDominanceDetermines2018
- AIM: meta-analysis of 252 herbivore exclusion experiments worldwide to investigate plant diversity-habitat productivity relationship
- Hypothesis: herbivore-induced changes in the competitive environment determine the response of plant biodiversity to herbivory irrespective of productivity
  - when reduction dominance palatable species -> increase biodiversity
  - when promotion dominance herbivory-resistant species -> reduce biodiversity
- Herbivory x richness along gradients
  - *+ relationship along ANPP, but low explanatory power (R^2^~0.08) & effect neutral to positive even at lowest productivity
  - no *correlation with annual precipitation
  - strong *- relationship against Berger-Parker dominance -> coherent with hypothesis
- Explanatory pathways of plant richness response to herbivory
  - ANPP model (chi2 = 11.8)
    - explanation change species richness *R^2^ = 0.13*
    - precipitation (+)*** ANPP (0.49)
    - ANPP (+)** change in richness (0.27)
    - site-level species richness (-)** change in richness (-0.21)
    - grazing pressure (-)* change in richness (-0.15)
    - herbivore richness, domestication & feeding guild NS
    -> *stronger (+) effect of grazing in high productivity & lower (-) effect of grazing pressure*
  - Berger-Parker dominance model (chi2 = 14) -> best fit
    - explanation change species richness *R^2^ = 0.31 -> best fit*
    - precipitation (+)*** ANPP (0.49)

    - site-level dominance (+)** change in richness (0.26)
    - domestication (+)** change in dominance (0.23)
    - ANPP (+)** change in richness (0.18)
    - grazing pressure (-)** change in richness (-0.18)
    - herbivore richness & site-level species richness NS
    -> *strong (+) effect of grazing when high dominance & (-) correlation between change in dominance & richness*
  - precipitation as proxy for ANPP model (chi2 = 2.93)
    - explanation change species richness *R^2^ = 0.11*
    - feeding guild (-)*** change in richness (-0.37)
    - herbivore richness (+)** change in richness (0.19)
    - domestication, grazing pressure & site-level species richness NS

    - domestication (+)* change in dominance (0.11)
    - grazing pressure (-)* change in richness (-0.11)
    -> *strong (-) relationship site-level dominance (no-grazing) & change in dominance*
- Simulation role of palatability in richness/dominance relationship
  - if dominant species palatable or 50% being palatable, very similar to observations = strong (-) relationship
  - if dominant species not palatable, relationship less clearly defined
- TAKE-HOME
  - neutral to positive effect of herbivory on richness even at low productivity, which increase with productivity
  - stronger role of dominance in determining plant richness response to grazing compared with productivity/precipitation
  - stronger effect of grazing on dominance in sites with high dominance
    
@kaltsasGroundBeetlesRespond2013
- AIM: to assess the effect of goat & sheep grazing on Carabidae diversity & assemblages in Mediterreanea shrublands at different elevations
- Elevation levels: 0-399 m (ALT1); 400-699 m (ALT2); 700-1599 m (ALT3); 1600-2199 m (ALT4)
- Grazing intensity levels (indicator species): no grazing; occasional; low intensity; intermediate; intense; overgrazing
- Community composition
  - main drivers (pairwise): elevation* (0.43) > year of study* (0.21) > habitat type* (0.18)
  - grazing level only marginally significant with very low explanatory power (0.062)
- Species diversity (multiple regression)
  - no effect of any driver on species richness, Shannon, Simpson, average species richness per sampling period
  - only grazing affected temporal turnover & temporal diversity
- Species diversity x grazing intensity
  - ~hump-shaped: species richness, species richness per sampling period
  - linear decrease: temporal turnover = richness per sampling period/species richness
  - linear increase: temporal diversity = temporal change of site assemblage structure
- TAKE-HOME: community mostly driven by elevation gradient while diversity affected by grazing regimes

@graceRelationshipSpeciesDensity1999
- AIM: to test structural equation models to investigate the relationship between plant species density & aboveground biomass in grazed & ungrazed coastal meadows
- Initial model with 4 predictors: habitat, grazing, flooding regime & soil/parent material
- Rather good fit on general model:
  - species density: flooding regime (0.56) > grazing (0.28) > biomass (0.21) > soil (0.17) > site (0.11)
  - biomass: soil (0.51) > flooding regime (0.33) > site (0.09) > grazing (NS)
  - predictor interactions: site x soil (0.24); soil x grazing (0.47); flooding regime x grazing (0.09)
- Different models according to grazing treatment
  - Ungrazed: 
    - 56% variance explained for species density but only 31% for biomass
    - species density: flooding regime (0.56) > biomass (0.3) > soil (0.23) > site (0.17)
    - biomass: flooding regime (0.4) > soil (0.36) > site (0.1)
    - predictor interactions: non significant
    - stronger correlation biomass x species density
  - Grazed:
    - 30% variance explained for species density & 41% for biomass
    - species density: flooding regime (0.57) > soil, site & biomass NS
    - biomass: soil (0.59) > flooding regime (0.31) > site (0.09)
    - predictor interactions (different from global model): site x soil (0.43); flooding regime x soil (0.25)
- TAKE-HOME: 
  - species density & biomass do not respond to the same predictors
  - grazing affects not only species density & biomass response, but also interactions between predictors

- Grazing capacities
  - similar seasonal patterns for both nutrient-rich & poor: summer & fall > winter > spring

- TAKE-HOME:
  - similar seasonal patterns of grazing capacities independently of grazer and habitat
  - nutrient content: lowest in spring for nutrient-poor while in winter for nutrient-rich
  - digestibility: highest in summer & fall for nutrient-poor while in spring for nutrient-rich independently of grazer

@davisEffectsTimingGrazing2014
- AIM: to assess the effect of cattle grazing timing on plant & arthropod communities in mountain (~2000 masl) grassland experiments (wet meadow & upland)
- Treatments: early grazing (from mid-June), traditional late grazing (from mid-July) & no grazing (control)
- Habitat differences (control)
  - forb & graminoid biomass & arthropod density wet meadow > upland
  - in wet meadow only, total arthropod density positively correlated with graminoid & forb biomass
  - in upland only, cumulative soil moisture negatively correlated with end-of-season graminoid & forb biomass
- Timing grazing x uplands across growing season
  - graminoid biomass
    - constant through all season in control
    - *reduced by late grazing by 47%
    - NS lower by at least 30% in grazing compared with control
  - forb biomass
    - constant through all season in control
    - *reduced by early (73%) & late (69%) grazing
    - *lower by at least 50% in grazing compared with control
  - average plant height:
    - strongly correlated with graminoid biomass
    - despite equal graminoid biomass, plant height early >* late grazing by the end of the grazing season
  - Arthropod community: arthropod density & biomass mainly made of Hemiptera (57%), Hymenoptera (23%) & Araneae (10%)
  - Hemiptera density
    - constant across grazing season for control & early graze
    - *reduced by 54% in late grazing
  - Hemiptera body size: no effect

- TAKE-HOME: significant plant & Hemiptera biomass reduction under grazing after only one season independently of timing, but no sign of greater biomass recovery early vs late

@milchunasGeneralizedModelEffects1988
- AIM: to propose a model based on environmental moisture & grazing evolutionary history to explain grazer-grassland interactions across a wide range of communities
- 3 types of grasslands: climatically determined, successional or agricultural -> model constrained to climatically determined
- Standard assumption that intermediate disturbance level hypothesis results from reduction in competitive exclusion -> but grazing can also affect:
  - the relative importance of mode of competition
  - the longevity of the change in competitive relationships after the grazing event -> temporal window influenced by environmental factors (water, nutrients availability...) & relaxed of competitive interactions
- Model assumption: "the response of plant communities to grazing is mediated through an interaction of convergent or divergent selection pressures along the moisture gradient and factors relating to a tolerance or an intolerance of grazing along the evolutionary-history-of-grazing gradient

@cingolaniGrazingEffectsRangeland2005
- AIM: to review conceptual models on effect of grazing on vegetation in rangelands and to propose modification for optimisation prediction diversity response to grazing
- Two previously developed models
  - multiple-equilibrium, state-and-transition or state-and-threshold model: each rangeland system with a single equilibrium composition in the absence of grazing, but divergence, that can be reversed, created by grazing -> any variable of the system is a single, smooth, continuous & reversible function of grazing intensity
  - generalised model of the effects of grazing on plant community structure & diversity: predict behaviour plant community structure in relation to grazing intensity along gradients of precipitation & evolutionary history of grazing -> implies that in a given site there is a single diversity value & community composition for every grazing intensity
- **interrupted at "Modifying the MSL model"**

@chabuzImpactTypeUse2019
- AIM: to assess effect grazing management with local breed & intensity on vegetation community & nutritional value within context of animal welfare in Natura 2000 mountainous region (500-600 masl)
- Types of management:
  - 1. extensive seasonal sheep & cattle local breed (0.49 LSU), no enrichment
  - 2. year round horse & cattle grazing (1.63 LSU) with organic fertiliser & harrowing once a year
  - 3. alternating cattle grazing (0.79 LSU) & mowing with organic fertiliser & sowing
  - 4. mowing 2-3 times a year
  - 5. abandoned
- Animal welfare (**no stat test**)
  - crude protein 2 & 3 > 1
  - energy requirement for lactating cow met for all grazing management
- Floristic diversity: similar vegetation regardless of grazing animal
- TAKE-HOME: both seasonal extensive and yearly moderate management with local breed ensure energy requirement of grazer

@cesaChangesVegetationStructure2011

@briskeRotationalGrazingRangelands2008
- **tres cool :-)**
- AIM: review implications & research of rotational vs continuous **rangeland** grazing systems
- Why complicated to come up with general recommendations when it comes to grazing systems
  - 1) wide range ecological variation from inherent & management sources
  - 2) farmer/manager commitment ability (ownership, revenue...)
  -> if only considering ecological implications, per default rotational management would be considered as more beneficial than continuous - but managerial implications can actually drive both the best and the worst of any grazing system
- Core principles of vegetation response to grazing:
  - 1) Chronic, intensive grazing detrimental to plant growth & survival
  - 2) Primary productivity can be increased by moderate grazing and decrease under severe grazing
  - 3) Forage quality is often improved by frequent grazing
  - 4) Species composition of plant communities can be modified in response to the frequency, intensity & seasonality of grazing
    - mitigation competition by selective grazing
    - grazing patchiness
- Results from experimental research for similar stocking rates
  - plant production/standing crop: 17/19 reported no difference
  - animal production per head: 16/28 reported no difference, 10/28 reported continuous > rotational
  - animal production per unit land area: 16/28 reported no difference, 10/28 reported continuous > rotational
  -> no better production under rotational compared with continuous
- Why high expectations?
  - overestimated benefits of rotational grazing: following degradation rangelands, continuous grazing criticized on the same ground as high intensity
  - environmental constraints: different ecological dynamics (hydric limitation) & managerial requirements in rangeland systems compared with mesic pasture systems that have high & consistent plant production

- TAKE-HOME:
  - increase diversity & abundance of butterflies & bumblebees under rotational grazing, when grazed by cattle & when grazing excluded during flowering period
  - ground beetle diversity, abundance & community unaffected
  - performance & herbage production similar between continuous & rotational
  -> no trade-offs between productivity & biodiversity

  - plant biomass with lower concentration of P, C, K, Ca, acid & neutral detergent under grazing -> lower quality fodder
  - competitors favoured by absence grazing, ruderals favoured by grazing
  - plant species composition driven by first nutrient gradient & second management -> smaller difference between treatment in nutrient-poor soils compared with nutrient-rich ones

    - little to intermediate: unmanaged* < grazed < mowed*
    - intermediate to best: NS
- TAKE-HOME:
  - extensive management increase total species richness & meadow & grassland species
  - not much variation in ecological groups between grazing & mowing except from ruderal species, higher under cattle grazed
  - mowing increased perennials but decreased annuals & biannuals, while grazing mostly intermediate
  - overall grazing favoured more competitor species than mowing (intermediate), and management favoured competitors over non-management

@pakemanLongTermImpacts2019
- AIM: to assess long-term impact (2002-2017) of different grazing management (intensification, abandonment, diversification) on plant composition on marginal upland grasslands
- METHOD - treatments: control (0.9 ewe per ha), high (2.7 ewe per ha), mixed (0.6 sheep per ha + 2 cows each with single suckling calf for 4 weeks in fall), none.
- RESULT PLOT LEVEL
  - vegetation height lower* under more intensive grazing
  - litter cover overall unaffected by treatment but increased over years
  - species benefiting from higher intensity: *Juncus acutiflorus*, *Nardus stricta*, *Festuca ovina*, *Trichophorum cespitosum*, *Anthoxanthum odoratum*
  - species benefiting from grazing removal: *Narthecium ossifragum*, *Galium saxatile*, *Pteridium aquilinum*, *Vaccinium myrtillus*
  - species without consistent responses: *Agrostis canina*, *Agrostis capillaris*, *Carex panicea*, *Deschampsia flexuosa*, *Molinia caerulea*, *Potentilla erecta*
  - species declining with cow introduction: *Pteridium aquilinum*, *Vaccinium myrtillus*
  - dominance: reduced to no grazing benefited *Ranunculus repens* and *Deschampsia cespitosa* while increased intensity benefited low growing species *Juncus squarrosus* & *Carex pilulifera*
  - diversity: Shannon & species richness higher in high intensity compared to control in 2017
- RESULT COMMUNITY LEVEL
  - *Agrostis-Festuca* communities: divergence mostly under higher intensity grazing
  - *Nardus* communities: divergence mostly under abandonment
  - wet heath communities: divergence both high intensity & abandonment, mixed as intermediate and close to control
  - *Carex* mire communities: same as wet heath but mixed as intermediate between control & intensive
  - *Molinia* mire communities: same as *Carex* mire, but abandonment similar to control
  - interaction species x communities: most species responses consistent across communities
  - interaction species x habitat productivity:
    - *Agrostis capillaris*, *Anthoxantum odoratum*, *Holcus lanatus*, *Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus* consistently increased under higher grazing intensity
    - *Galium saxatile* response to grazing differed according to habitat productivity -> positive more productive & negative in less productive habitats

@aldayEffectsLongtermRemoval2021
- AIM: 40 years monitoring of vegetation changes in UK upland habitats under sheep grazing and grazing removal
- METHOD: habitat types - high-level, base-rich grasslands (Agrostis/Festuca); intermediate grasslands (Nardus/Juncus); Blanket bog (Calluna/Eriophorum); high-level bog (Eriophorum dominated)
- high-level grasslands (3 sites) - different trends according to sites
  - #1 community stable between grazed/ungrazed
  - #2 ungrazed grows towards increase vascular/decrease cryptogams, while grazed more unpredictible
  - #3 ungrazed grows towards increase vascular/decrease cryptogams while grazed grows towards increase graminoids
- intermediate grasslands (2 sites) - similar trends for sites & treatments
  - opposite direction species richness
  - towards *P. schreberi*, *R. squarrosus* & *Sphagnum capillifolium*
- blanket bog (5 sites) - similar trends for sites & treatments
  - towards increase bryophytes
- high-level bogs (2 sites) - trajectories similar for sites but slightly different for treatments
  - #1 similar trend between grazed & ungrazed towards increasing species richness & *Avenella flexuosa* & *Calluna vulgaris*
  - #2 grazed similar to other site, but ungrazed moved towards decreasing species richness while still keeping *Avenella flexuosa* & *Calluna vulgaris* direction
- TAKE-HOME
  - no "wholesale" change in composition dominant species, but fluctuation/decline sub-dominant species
  - species richness towards decrease over time (follow standard successional trends) but depends on species pools of surrounding community types
  - in most experiments ungrazed & grazed trajectories similar, with the exception of high-level grasslands
  - reduction in species richness mostly associated with reduction in cryptogams & more particularly liverworts & lichens

@rosefDynamicsDeschampsiaCespitosa2004
- AIM: to investigate response of *Deschampsia cespitosa* in two abandoned fields under continuous/rotational & cattle/sheep grazing
- species cover
  - for site 1, cattle continuous grazing different than sheep grazing but similar to ungrazed
  - for site 2, all grazing treatment similar but continuous cattle grazing different to ungrazed
- germination - both sites with rotational grazing (both sheep & cattle) different to control
- tussock
  - for site 1, ungrazed & cattle continuous grazing different than all other treatments
  - for site 2, no difference between grazing treatments & control
- TAKE-HOME: **c'est complique - difficile de comprendre ce papier...**
  
@pakemanConsistencyPlantSpecies2004
- AIM: meta-analysis on response of plant species & traits to grazing intensity on experimental fields at different productivity levels
- 9 out of 22 species showed consistent response to changing grazing intensity
  - + *Anthoxantum odoratum*, *Cerastium fontanum*, *Galium saxatile*, *Juncus effusus*, *Lolium perenne*, *Trifolium repens*
  - - *Deschampsia flexuosa*, *Molinia caerulea*, *Phleum pratense*
- Associated traits with species favoured by grazing:
  - regeneration niche provided by trampling - *Cerastium fontanum* & *Poa annua*
  - species weaker for light competition - *Lolium perenne* & *Trifolium repens*
  - species avoided by animals - *Juncus squarrosus* & *Carex* spp.
- Attributes of traits favoured by increase grazing: short life span & fast regeneration & growth (annual life history, seasonal regeneration by seed), ruderal strategy, rosette formers, plant with higher requirement for light
- Attributes traits favoured by decrease grazing: competitors, species with perennial life history, regeneration from buried seed bank and species preferred by sheep
- Effect of productivity
  - 5 out of 18 species had response to grazing modulated by productivity
  - *Nardus stricta* increased under grazing at low productivity but decreased at high productivity
  - *Poa trivialis* decreased less under grazing in high productive sites
- TAKE-HOME: grazing intensity favoured short-lived, early seasonal, ruderal species with higher light requirement

@marriottLongtermImpactsExtensive2009
- AIM: 16 year experiment to compare effect of sheep grazing intensity on productivity, species composition & plant diversity in upland grazing areas (245-367 m)
- METHOD: treatments were abandonment, 8 cm-sward, 4 cm-sward & intensive (4 cm-sward with fertilisation)
- big divergence in composition between abandonment & intensive within the first 5 years, and then stabilisation
  - species favoured by removal: *Holcus lanatus*, *Poa pratensis*, *Ranunculus repens*
  - species declining under removal: *Lolium perenne*, *Poa annua*, *Trifolium repens*
- extensive 8 & 4 treatments diverged only slightly & slowly from intensive
  - species favoured by extensification: *Festuca rubra*, *Holcus lanatus*, *Agrostis capillaris*, *Poa trivialis*, *Trifolium repens*
  - species declining under extensification: *Deschampsia cespitosa*, *Lolium perenne*, *Poa annua*
- species favoured by extension but declining under abandonment: *Agrostis capillaris*, *Poa trivialis*, *Trifolium repens*
- Productivity:
  - stable stocking rate for 8 cm-sward, but one out of two 4 cm-sward with declining actual stocking rate
  - no increase of undesirable species such as Cirsium, Juncus, Rumex with extension
- Species richness: consistently higher with extensive grazing compared with intensive, but no hints that increase would continue & not much difference between 4-cm & 8-cm swards either -> change suspected to be driven by cessation fertilisation
- TAKE-HOME:
  - no change of sward structure and marginal, if not at all, loss of productivity when extensification of grazing in upland areas
  - slow changes in community composition, which has yet to stabilise, & small increase of diversity

@marrsReleaseSheepGrazing2020
- AIM: to test the Wet Desert hypothesis, whether long-term sheep grazing selectively removed/reduced species according to micro & macro nutrient concentrations & digestibility in UK uplands (Moor House NNR experiment)
- Species characteristics
  - *Rumex acetosa* in top for 6 micro-nutrients (Cl, S, Fe, Mn, Cu, Ni)
  - *Potentilla erecta* in top for 6 macro-nutrients (C, P, K, Na, Mg, Ca), but none micro-nutrients
  - *Narthecium ossifragum*, *Rumex acetosa* & *Potentilla erecta* with lowest fibre concentration (ADF, NDF or both) therefore more digestible
  - *Narthecium ossifragum* & *Potentilla erecta* both among highest DOMD (energy measure) & protein concentration
  - *Rumex acetosa* among highest protein concentration
  - *Rumex acetosa* & *Narthecium ossifragum* both among lowest SI concentration (palatability) & C:N ratio (decomposability)
  - *Potentilla erecta* among lowest C:N ratio
- Cessation of grazing favoured species found in predominantly Calluna-Eriophorum vegetation (e.g. *Narthecium ossifragum*) while grassland-associated species (*Rumex acetosa* & *Potentilla erecta*) were only weakly affected with increase becoming detectable after 60 years
- TAKE-HOME: 
  - long-term sheep grazing has selectively removed palatable & nutritious species which recovered with higher nutrient & digestibility after sheep removal
  - recovery of heath vegetation after 10-20 years period, but only after 60 years for high-altitude grasslands

@milliganWinnersLosersLongterm2016
- AIM: to monitor changes in plant diversity and functional group in sheep-grazed/ungrazed long-term experiments in UK uplands (Moor House NNR experiment)
- HYP - directional change towards conservation enhancement or loss (homogenisation) in relation to sheep grazing or removal
- Variation communities over time
  - overall little strict evolution but lots of fluctuations
  - 2 out of 9 sites (*Nardus stricta* grassland & Agrosto-Festucetum) with similar pathways between grazed and ungrazed
  - 3 out of 9 sites (*Calluna-Eriophorum*, calcareous flush, Festucetum) with divergence
  - 4 out of 9 sites (Eriophoretum x2. *Juncus squarrosus* grassland, Festucetum) with movements in opposite direction
- Species richness consistently decline overtime whichever treatment, but Shannon-Weiner index increased under ungrazed when remained stable under grazing
- Probability of occurrence
  - decline for both treatments: lichens (same), liverworts (faster for ungrazed)
  - increase for both treatments: herbs (faster ungrazed), grasses (same), segdes (same), mosses (faster ungrazed)
  - shrub slight increase for ungrazed, stable for grazed
- Change in abundance
  - decline for both treatments: grasses (faster ungrazed), liverworts (same), lichens (faster grazed), vascular plants (same)
  - increase for both treatments: herbs (faster ungrazed), sedges (faster ungrazed), shrubs (faster ungrazed)
  - mosses declined for grazed by slightly increased under ungrazed
- TAKE-HOME: 
  - impoverishment over time regardless management particularly regarding lichens & liverworts
  - compensation of ungrazed treatment for mosses

@milliganEffectsRotationalPrescribed2018
- AIM: -> not the most pressing, to do later

@olffEffectsHerbivoresGrassland1998
- AIM: review on herbivore impact on grassland plant diversity to propose a new conceptual model linking plant species richness to grazing -> **classic**
- Effect herbivores on plant species richness depends on 
  - type & abundance of herbivore species in particular environment -> usually (+) at low/moderate stocking rates, (-) at high stocking rates
  - spatial/temporal scales at which diversity is measured or affected
  - interaction herbivore body size x scale diversity -> local effect large herbivores at larger spatial scale
  - productivity system -> grazing more optimal on high productive fields
- Mechanisms plant species richness
  - balance between local colonization & extinction rates of species
  - herbivore body size could explain direction, magnitude & scale of effects
  - plant div/herbivore relationship depends on environmental gradients
- existing concepts
  - resource partitioning
  - local colonization from regional species pool
  -> merging both following island biogeography theory, with colonization depending on regional species pool & extinction from local competition
  -> "ultimate effect of herbivores on plant diversity might depend on their relative impacts on biomass & reproduction of dominant plant species, the density & type of regeneration sites & the supply of propagules from rare plants"
- Environmental gradient
  - soil fertility & precipitation gradients
  - plant tissue which influence palatability depends on ratio resource supply
  - classification habitats 4 categories according to wet/dry, productive/unproductive
  - wet infertile
    - dominant plants with low tissue nutrient concentrations but productive enough to induce light competition
    - grazing by large grazers (livestock) may shift local competition from light to soil nutrient allowing more species to coexist
  - wet fertile
    - dominant plants productive, important light competition 
    - strong competitors (tall) more likely to be unpalatable due to stem:leaf ratio to all but large herbivores
    - grazing opens canopy & enhance grazing-tolerant species over tall species -> high density of grazers supported by fast regrowing species would affect non-grazing tolerant species

@lennartssonEffectTimingGrassland2012
- **warning** need to check journal
- AIM: 6-years experiment on two grasslands to compare the effect of cattle grazing period on plant composition & phenology
- METHOD - continuous May-September vs late mid-July-September
- no effect grassland/period on plant species richness
- reproduction: mean density reproductive units late >* continuous
- species-specific responses fruit production
  - for one grassland, relative fruit production late >* continuous
  - not enough replicates in other grassland
  - mean relative fruit production single species (-) correlated with date fruit maturation -> more prominent late grazing
  - no effect grazing preference (first grazed species when introduction grazers)
  - no correlation with light index, plant height, abortion reproductive units
- diversity & species richness after 6 years
  - Shannon late >* continuous
  - richness late >* continuous
- vegetation height & shoot grazing
  - height affected in early season only
  - no direct effect grazing regime on shoot grazing
- TAKE-HOME: late grazing enhance fruit production & species diversity

@bakkerHerbivoreImpactGrassland2006
- AIM: 7-year experiment testing herbivore size along a 10-fold productivity gradient on plant species richness
- METHOD - sizes define as > 30 kg, < 10 kg & < 1 kg
- significant effect herbivore x aboveground productivity independent of scale
  - high prod: (+)* species richness & exclusive species
  - low prod: (+)* exclusive species but (-)* species richness

@krahulecVegetationChangesFollowing2001
- AIM: to assess plant communities following restoration of abandoned cattle-grazed meadows by sheep grazing for ~8 years + new assessment after 3 years of second abandonment
- after sheep grazing: increase cover of *Festuca rubra*, *Poa pratensis*, *Holcus mollis*, *Deschampsia cespitosa*, *Deschampsia flexuosa*, *Agrostis capillaris*
- after new cessation: increase "tall nitrophilous" species such as *Deschampsia cespitosa*
- *Deschampsia cespitosa* -> expansion during and after grazing

@buzhdyganDirectIndirectEffects2020
- AIM: to investigate direct & indirect effects of grazing on plant communities of cattle-grazed semi-natural grasslands along an elevation gradient (230-515 masl)
- *method point*: structural equation modelling with "only" 31 sites, at different locations (plains, foothills, mountains)
- Species richness 
  - (-)* cattle density by direct effect
  - (+)* elevation by direct effect
  - (-)* elevation by indirect effect -> (-) soil pH -> (-) earthworm biomass
  - no significant grazing x elevation effect
  - overall stronger effect of grazing over elevation
- functional diversity
  - cattle density only significant indirectly through bare soil
  - (-)* cattle density -> (-) sp legumes
  - no effect elevation
- % undesirable species
  - cattle density only significant indirectly through bare soil
  - (+)* cattle density -> (+) sp non-legume forbs, rushes, sedges
  - (+) LM elevation only for sp rushes & sedges
- community composition (NMDS) -> significant effect of cattle density & elevation, but no interaction

@bakkerDoesResourceAvailability2003
- AIM: investigate interaction between native grazer & plant species richness on long-term experiment (1990-98)
  - H1 - bison grazing enhances levels resource availability (light, N) -> co-occurrences competitive species
  - H2 - spatial heterogeneity in resource availability is enhanced by bison -> coexistence greater species number
  - H3 - increased species turnover under grazing associated with higher species richness
- METHOD 
  - 4 treatments grazed/ungrazed x upland/lowland
  - variables: plant species composition, soil nutrients, light
- RESULTS
  - grazing increased species richness & plant community heterogeneity
  - H1 - higher light & N availability under grazing, no difference in mean soil water content
  - H2 - resource heterogeneity greater for light & N under grazing, no difference for soil water content
  - H3 - higher species turnover under grazing
  - strong correlation species richness with light penetration to soil & to lesser extent soil N
  - strong correlation species richness with light heterogeneity
  - strong correlation light level & heterogeneity
- TAKE-HOME: higher species richness under grazing, potentially driven by light availability and to a lesser extent N concentration (but not N distribution)

@milchunasQuantitativeEffectsGrazing1993
- AIM: meta-analysis of grazing effect on vegetation and soil
- Main drivers of species composition (>50% variance): aboveground net primary production, evolutionary grazing history & consumption level
- Ecosystem-environmental variables (ANPP, evolutionary history) contributed more than grazing variables (consumption)
- Contradicting responses of species dominance under grazing -> effect most sensitive to evolutionary history & grazing variables
- Difference in ANPP between grazed vs ungrazed negatively related to increasing years of treatment, levels of consumption & site productivity

@skornikEffectGrazingPressure2010
- AIM: 10 years experiment to study sheep grazing intensity & abandonment on plant species richness and composition in Mediterranean grasslands
- Categories of grazing intensities: heavy with 12 sheep/ha, moderate with 7 sheep/ha, light with 4 sheep/ha
- significant differences in species richness for different levels of grazing pressure: low-intensity (22.0 +- 2.5) > moderate > high (12.2 +- 2.5)
- heavy grazing with distinct community composition, with 25 exclusive species such as *Achillea millefolium*, *Dactylis glomerata*, *Festuca pratensis*, *Festuca rubra*, *Poa pratensis* -> species from mesic soils (relatively nutrient rich)
- no substantial difference in community composition between light and moderate grazing
- on grasslands with similar productivity potential (biomass in exclosure), residual standing biomass significantly higher under low-intensity & belowground biomass significantly lower under high-intensity

@boavistaEffectsGrazingRegimes2019
- AIM: 6-years experiment between constant vs rotational cattle grazing in Brazil
- Distinct community composition between continuous and rotational grazing -> increase of prostrate species biomass under rotational grazing and a decrease of species dominance
- Significant increase of total biomass, including forage grasses
- Species richness, Shannon diversity & evenness increased under rotational grazing

@lezamaVariationGrazinginducedVegetation2014
- AIM: Survey on grazing impact on plant composition, species richness, betadiv & life-form abundance between a low and a high productivity groups with paired grazed/ungrazed sites
- Changes in species composition between grazed and ungrazed plots increased with site productivity -> relationship significant between the two productivity groups and within the high productivity group
- On average grazing had positive effect on species richness across the gradient, but magnitude of impact strongly associated with site productivity: high productivity plots clearly above equality line (x ungrazed vs y grazed) while low productivity mostly along or even slightly below the equality line
- On average grazing had negative effect on beta-div, with stronger impact on sites with high betadiv. High productivity group was more affected than low productivity group
- Grazing reduced cover of dominant species, with a stronger effect in high productivity group
- Positive effect on richness no clearly linked to shrub or graminoid richness
- No clear effect of grazing on graminoid cover, whichever productivity group

### ANIMAL COMPARISON

@eliasGoatPasturingBiological2016
- AIM: to investigate the foraging behaviour of goats (0.6-0.8 LSU/ha) on 3 encroached dry grasslands
- TAKE-HOME: 
  - goats can overlook plant defense mechanisms (thorns) when frequent in the assemblage
  - browsing time spring tends to be higher than in summer & autumn
  - goats good restoration tools for encroached grasslands

@rookMatchingTypeLivestock2004
- REVIEW: grazing-pasture biodiversity mechanisms with focus on livestock type
- Sward heterogeneity
  - selective defoliation resulting from dietary choices
  - directional/random trampling favouring gap-colonising species
  - patch-like nutrient deposition locally increasing competition
  - endo- & exozoochory
- Animal behaviour
  - animal strategy does not always follow resource optimisation
  - relative importance "currencies" (limiting factors) depends on habitat deficiencies, animal health (parasitism), antiparisitic properties of some plants (selective adaptation)
  - time effect: observed daily routines maybe linked to digestibility
  - spatial effect: animal routines mostly observed in uplands where animals free to move around
- Body size: small herbivores usually have higher energy/gut size ratio than large herbivores & thus select higher quality food
- Feeding category
  - mouth size: sheep & goats able to be more selective on plant material than cattle, so they can pick biomass in less desirable area where cattle would avoid it overall
  - mouth/teeth shape: sheep, goats & horse able to graze closer to ground compared with cattle
- Breed
  - even though rustic breeds perceived as better suited for grassland conservation in terms of both biodiversity & animal performance, strong experimental evidence still lacking
  - breed differences could be "simply" explained by body size differences, even if different behaviour patterns already observed
- Learning & experience
  - preferences can be maintained from early-age experiences, but duration quite variable from a few weeks to whole grazing season
  - hints that breed x experience effects but not much evidence
- Economical implications
  - rustic advantage: reproduction performance maintained when underfed in winter
  - higher prices result not only from breed itself but most importantly whole system associated with it
- Perspectives
  - to determine innate vs learnt behaviour & selectivity
  - to identify currencies which drive animal strategies in different circumstances
  - to improve & generalise our understanding of animal effect on spatial distribution of foraging
  - to develop socio-ecological frame of agricultural landscape

@liuImpactsGrazingDifferent2015

  - Shannon: cattle* > mixed > control > sheep*
  - Pielou's evenness: NS
  - plant height: control* > sheep > cattle* & mixed*
  - % plant cover: control* > mixed > cattle* & sheep*
  - AGB: control & sheep >* cattle & mixed
  - dissimilarity AGB: *higher with cattle (both single & mixed)
- High diversity steppe
  - plant species richness, Shannon & evenness: mixed >* all
  - plant height & % cover: NS
  - AGB: mixed* > control & cattle > sheep*
  - dissimilarity AGB: NS
- Plant composition
  - % forbs* decreased under sheep grazing in low diversity steppe & increased under mixed grazing in high diversity steppe
  - dissimilarity *higher under mixed grazing
- Diet overlap: low diversity (54%) > high diversity (28%)
- TAKE-HOME: 
  - mixed grazing suitable for high diversity steppe with synergy diversity/productivity
  - on short-term cattle most suitable for low-diversity steppe, but may be detrimental on the long-term following AGB decline
  - increased grazer selectivity (to their own type) in high diversity
  - forb declined in sheep grazing

@albonQuantifyingGrazingImpacts2007
- AIM: to assess the grazing & trampling impacts of domestic & wild grazers in upland heathland habitats
- Herbivore frequency: deer > sheep > cattle
- Predicted impact: sheep > cattle > rabbits & hares > deer
- Sheep x habitat: *impact on almost all smooth grasslands (10/11) while only half blanket bogs (5/11)
- Comparison sheep-deer: ~2/3 habitats where both recorded *stronger sheep impact, & only 1 (blanket bog) with deer stronger
- Impact x density: deer impact increased with density but not sheep
- TAKE-HOME: on low-productive habitats, sheep grazing & trampling have greater impact than wild deer across a wide range of habitats & independently of density

@dumontPlantHerbivoreInteractions2011
- AIM: to compare effect of livestock (cow, sheep) & grazing intensity (13 LU/ha vs 6.5 LU/ha) on sward structure & plant functional groups in 6-years experiment
- Grazing intensity
  - legume abundance extensive cattle <*** intensive cattle from y0+2
  - grass abundance intensive cattle <*** extensive cattle from y0(+2*)+4
  - evenness functional types extensive <*** extensive cattle from y0(+2*)+4
- Livestock type in extensive grazing
  - grass abundance cattle <** sheep in y0+6
  - evenness functional types sheep <*** cattle in y0+6
- Forb abundance, species richness & species evenness NS either by treatment or type livestock
- Sward height: 
  - similar patterns for all treatments between start & end of rotation, with increase from mid-April to early July and decrease until November (~normal distribution)
  - overall sward height intensive cattle <*** extensive cattle
  - consistent lower*** sward height at end rotation for intensive cattle
  - no effect of livestock type
  - for both extensive cattle & sheep, sward height end rotation <*** start rotation only from early July
- Grazer intake according to management
  - intake short grasses, legumes & forbs extensive cattle <** intensive
  - intake tall grasses intensive cattle <* extensive
  - intake short grasses sheep <* cattle
- Selection across seasons
  - intake tall grass starts very low & decreases over time
  - intake short grass very low first & peaks in early July, then slowly reduces
  - intake forbs overall high and grows higher towards end of the season
  - very high legume selection across the whole sampling season, with significantly higher intake from sheep from June onwards
- TAKE-HOME: 
  - stronger and faster effect of stocking density compared to livestock type on plant functional groups & sward height
  - selection forbs & legumes for both species, even if sheep displayed stronger selection towards legumes in the second half of the season -> consequences visible in the community only 6 years after treatments
  - no effect of grazing treatment on species richness or evenness

@pratherPlantsRegulateGrassland2019
- AIM: to investigate the effects of plant biomass, habitat heterogeneity & plant quality on abundance & diversity of arthropod community in clipping experiment in sandy mixed-grass prairie
- Clipping & fertilisation x micro-climate
  - fertilisation increased biomass & decreased temperature, but only affected light by decrease in clipped treatment
  - clipping decreased biomass & increased light, but no effect on temperature
- Fertilisation x biomass & soil
  - NS C:N ratio grasses or forbs
  - *increased total plot C but NS total N
- Clipping & fertilisation x arthropod abundance
  - plant biomass best predictor compared with plant height & fertilisation for both abundance (vacuum) & activity (pitfall)
  - only fertilisation with NPK + micronutrient *increased vacuum abundance but not pitfall activity
  - *clipping decreased vacuum abundance but increased pitfall activity
- Clipping x arthropod diversity
  - clipping not most important factor despite consistent effect of plant height in models
  - vacuum: clear richness decrease & slight Shannon decrease
  - pitfall: Shannon decrease only under full clipping & NS richness
- Fertilisation x arthropod diversity: *increase richness but NS Shannon for both vacuum & pitfall
- Clipping & fertilisation x community composition
  - strong difference between pitfall & vacuum communities, but both *affected by micro-climate
  - *drivers vacuum: light incidence, average & max temperature, average humidity -> Acari associated with higher light
  - *drivers pitfall: plant biomass, light incidence, min temperature & average humidity -> Hymenoptera associated with low biomass while Coleoptera, Hemiptera & Orthoptera associated with high biomass

  - best explanatory power of vegetation structure in edge habitats for overall, detritivore & predator composition > farmland habitat > wood patch
  - most important vegetation structure parameters are litter cover & herbaceous cover for species composition
  - beetle species richness not well explained by vegetation structure
  - best vegetation structure predictors for beetle activity-density are litter cover, vegetation height, total herbaceous cover & plant diversity, but almost always when interacting with habitats and lots of contrasting effects depending on period for same habitats
  - only consistent response across whole season: lower detritivore density-activity in species rich patches

@harveyEffectsChangesPlant2008
- AIM: to investigate how 3y plant succession after experimental sowing affects Carabid assemblages in former cultivated land
- Sowing treatments: low diversity (4 species); high diversity (15 species); no sowing with 4-6y abandonment; no sowing with 2-4y abandonment
- Plant community: gradient 2-4yA - 4-6yA - LD - HD
- VG characteristics
  - % bare ground: abandoned >* sowed
  - grass cover: HD* > LD & 2-4yA > 4-6yA*
  - AGB: HD* > LD > abandoned*
  - Shannon: abandoned* > HD > LD*
- Beetle community
  - explanatory drivers: year (48%)* > VG characteristics (33%)* > sowing vs abandonment (9%)* > level sowing & abandonment (NS)
  - VG characteristics: all* but Shannon
- Feeding guilds: same trends for all treatments
  - Carnivores declined over years
  - Phytophages increased over years
  - Omnivorous peaked in the middle
- TAKE-HOME: 
  - beetle community driven by % bare ground, grass cover & AGB but not plant species richness
  - % feeding guilds consistently changed over time even within short-term abandonment, but no differences between treatments

@cingolaniCombinedEffectsEnvironment2003
- AIM: to assess the effect of topography, edaphic parameters & grazing intensity on mountain grasslands in central Argentina
- Method -> grazing related variables as "site use" rather than biomass uptake
  - recent intensity of grazing: dung frequency & soil impedance (proxy soil compaction) 
    -> for Amy note: dung frequency estimated by presence in 50 random 30 x 30 cm squares
    -> soil impedance assessed with penetrometer -> so similar to our soil penetration?
  - erosion in sampling area: bare surface & soil loss index
  - generalized erosion in a buffer of 30 x 30 m: exposed rock surface, active & inactive erosion edges
- Results on the different types of grasslands - xeric, mesic, wet
  - Topography - both elevation and slope significant, but elevation very high (2076-2192)
- **not finished, but warning - comparison variables between well-defined habitats, and not directly communities**

@reitaluDeterminantsFinescalePlant2014

-	Local environmental variables & biogeographic composition accounted for largest fractions of variability in species richness

@grimeCompetitiveExclusionHerbaceous1973
- AIM: explore exclusion patterns within plant communities along different competitive potentials -> la base pour le concept competition vs stress & confirmation intermediate disturbance theory
- Features of competitive species:
    - Tall plants (light)
    - Growth form made for extensive and intensive exploitation of the environment, such as dense rhizome or expanded tussock
    - High maximum potential growth rate
    - Tendency to deposit a dense layer of litter in the ground surface
- Species density (number sp/m) decreases when species with high competitive index are dominant, but this trend depends on the habitat type
- Factors which could mediate competition effects are environmental stresses (drought, poor soil) and human management (grazing, mowing, trampling)
- Balance in the community between stress-tolerant species, less productive, which decrease in softer environments to the advantage of more competitive and productive species.

@kiddImpacts120Years2017
- AIM: to assess the effect of manure & inorganic fertiliser treatment in a long-term grassland experiment on ecosystem properties & plant communities
- soil pH
  - pH manure >* pH mineral fertiliser but P & PK
  - pH manure decreases with depth -> neutralisation
  - pH mineral fertiliser increases with depth except for PK -> acidification
- olsen-P
  - P manure++ > N, K, NK & control
  - P manure decreases less drastically with depth
- exchangeable K: K manure & K >* N
- exchangeable Al:
  - Al N & MK >* manure apart when manure applied every other year
  - in manure++ no Al
- soil organic carbon stock
  - SOC manure++ >* N, P, NK & NPK (lower rate)
  - overall decrease of SOC with depth, with largest reduction in N, NK & NPK++
- total N stock -> highly correlated with SOC
- hay yield
  - yield manure++ > mineral fertiliser except for NPK++
  - differences quite small at start of experiment but became substantial with time
- plant community
  - 1st axis (60.5%) strongly positively associated with manure
    - + cover *Alopercurus pratensis*, *Bromus hordeaceus*, *Holcus lanatus* & *Poa trivialis*
    - - cover herbs & legumes, *Anthoxanthum odoratum*, *Agrostis capillaris*, *Festuca rubra*
  - 2nd axis (15.6%) negatively associated with N & positively associated with P
    - mineral N & NK: very low species richness & herb cover, no legumes or bryophytes
    - control & P: higher species richness, herb & legume cover but lowest cover grass species
    - bryophytes only present in control, K & NP

  - evolution over time
    - increased dissimilarity P+ & PK
    - increased similarity P+ & N+
    - increased similarity N+PK, N++PK & PK - decrease share grass over forb for N+PK & N++PK
- Yield: substantially highest for N+PK & N++PK in the first period but strongly reduced in the second period
- Soil pH increased in all treatments from 1981 to 2007, with lowest pH for N++PK

@merunkovaEnvironmentalControlSpecies2012
- AIM: to assess relationships of species richness & composition with soil variables in upland grasslands
- Species richness: 
  - vascular declined with increasing P & K availability & organic matter content
  - bryophytes declined with increasing P availability but was higher in acidic soils with low Ca content
  - on lower grasslands, heat load increased vascular species richness when tall sward & increased bryophyte richness on shallow soil
  - main determinants of vascular species richness: soil moisture > pH > phosphorus
  - main determinants of bryophyte species richness: soil moisture > organic matter
- Species composition
  - main gradient: soil moisture > soil nutrient availability & reactivity (including pH) - even though significant, still low explanation % with at most 3% for individual parameter
  - pH paired with productivity gradient with dry low-productive oligotrophic soils against tall productive
  - stronger factors of variation of species: organic matter content > heat load > available Ca > soil depth

@critchleyAssociationLowlandGrassland2002
- AIM: to identify soil-plant community relationships on lowland grasslands in UK

  - total NS
  - significant decrease of forbs & increase of grass
  - forb biomass associated with pH changes in NO3- & Mg2+

- AIM: to assess spatial & temporal variability in soil inorganic N, P, K & moisture
- Output:
  - temporal variability for N & soil moisture with increase from April to June
  - spatial clumping of P & K around shrubs

@halingEffectSoilAcidity2011
- AIM: to assess if roots of acid-tolerant plants have advantages compared to acid-sensitive genotypes in pH-stress environments
- Soil acidity overall affected root length & architecture, root hair development, & root tip shape
- Potential acidity x soil strength interaction, with no root length limitation of acid-tolerant species at low soil strength, but inhibition at higher strength

@kumiQuantifyingRootinducedSoil2023
- AIM: to experimentally assess the effect of root density & physical parameters on soil resistance of sand & sandy clay loam
- METHOD
  - Soil penetration resistance assessed with cone index -> we should not use this terminology as our method is not standardised
  - GWC determined as difference between saturated (in-field saturation with natural drainage) and oven dried soil -> similar to what we did with soil saturation and natural drainage for 48h
  - how to describe penetrometer - cone degree & base area
- Soil penetration resistance significantly affected by crop plants, soil types & soil depths
- Soil penetration overall poorly associated with GWC at 0-20 cm soil depth
- Relationships soil penetration x plant parameters not always consistent according to plant species & soil type
  - overall soil penetration negatively correlated with average plant root diameter
  - Soil resistance of beach sand overall negatively correlated with root volume
  - Soil resistance of sandy clay loam rather negatively correlated with root volume, but with a few contradictory results
  - Response to branching frequency & root length density very variable & inconsistent
  - overall, sandy soil with more extreme correlations than sandy clay loam
- TAKE-HOME: root system contributes to soil penetration resistance 

@gabrielCoverCropsReduce2021
- AIM: 10-year experiment to assess how cover crops (*Hordeum vulgare* & *Vicia* sp) influence soil penetration resistance & water content
- TAKE-HOME: strong correlation between soil penetration resistance and soil water content up to 5 cm depth

@sojkaSituStrengthBulk2001
- AIM: to assess *in situ* relationship between soil strength (cone index), bulk density and water content
- Bulk density better determinant of soil strength than water content on entire profile, but at 0.15-0.30 & 0.30-0.45 cm depth water content as much explanatory
- Still, despite relatively large dataset robust correlations difficult to obtain -> thus relationships still rather ambiguous
- TAKE-HOME: Soil water content can be as good predictor, if not better depending on soil layer, than bulk density of soil resistance, but overall relationships not that well established

@andersonRainfallSoilsModify2007
- **attention, doit etre relu plus en details pour un better take-home**
- AIM: ecological study on plant community response to grazing exclusion and available N & P in grasslands grazed by native ungulates Tanzania
- Plant biomass
  - No relationship between rainfall, plant biomass & soil available N & P independently of grazing
- Plant species richness
  - Decreased with exclusion of herbivores
    - Decrease was more important as exclusion provoked an increase of soil available P
  - Unimodal response to rain, independently of grazing management
- Plant composition
  - Within-site composition similarity slightly decreased with grazer exclusion
  - No observed effect of P and N
  - Combined effect rain & grazing -> species turnover induced by grazing increased with rainfall
  - higher sedge in grazed plots & higher forbs in exclosures

@augustineFeedbacksSoilNutrients2003
- AIM: to investigate relationships among soil N & P, primary production, grass nutrient content & grazing in savanna grazed by cattle -> very specific to savanna context, so limited scope
- interaction rainfall x primary prod decreases with long-term abandonment
- higher water-holding capacity, soil nutrients and organic matter content in managed habitats compared to abandoned
- N:P ratio in herbaceous biomass
  - increased with N fertilisation
  - was not affected by P fertilisation
- N redistribution
  - in managed habitat, N deposition through dung & urine exceeded total N consumption in forage
  - in bushland, N forage consumed exceeded N deposition

@klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007
- Nitrogen fertilization: grasslands with *Stellaria media*, *Poa annua* & *Poa trivialis* positively correlated, while *Ranunculus acris*, *Trifolium pratense* and *Rumex acetosa* negatively correlated

@chanetonNitrogenPhosphorusCycling1996
- AIM: to investigate pools and exchanges of N & P in grazed and ungrazed grasslands in Argentina
- Nutrient concentration in vegetation
  - [N] decreases in shoot & increases in roots along the growing season
  - Higher [N] in graminoid shoot with grazing
  - no apparent change of [P] of live shoot & roots over time and with/without grazing
  - [N] and [P] in standing dead shoots decreased over time in grazed plot but increased in exclosure
  - N:P ratio
    - P-limited at the end of the growing season
    - N-limited in late spring
    - in early winter, graminoid more P-limited under grazing while forbs more P-limited without grazing
- Nutrient distribution
  - at peak standing biomass, ~95-98% tot N & P contained in soil organic matter
  - N & P proportion always larger in belowground biomass independently of grazing management
  - tot N & P in roots increased with grazing
  - difference according to life form
    - forb shoots with high nutrient content under grazing
    - graminoid shoots with 3-5 times lower nutrient content under grazing
- Nutrient flow
  - N uptake 30% higher & twice the rate of root growth allocation under grazing
  - P uptake 50% higher under grazing
  - forage intake 62% tot N & 44% tot P translocated to live shoots
  - nutrients recycled by grazing animals which entered soil mineral pool made 66% for N & 80% for P of totals excreted, and about 17% of total nutrient returned to soil
  - net N & P mineralization rate 11% and 38% higher under grazing -> soil microbiota retains more nutrient without grazing
  
@hejcmanRengenGrasslandExperiment2010
- AIM: to test the long-term (64 years) effect of soil chemical properties on biomass production, plant composition & species richness
- Even after 60 years, stability in soil nutrient status yet to be reached, with substantial differences between P/no P treatments in the last 10 years
- Strongest biomass increase with P & K under N application
- All measured soil properties explained 61.7% of variability in plant species composition, with 56.6% explained by P, K, Mg & pH
  - high correlation between P content & effect treatment
  - correlation pH with other soil nutrients & treatment
  - K correlated with treatment but relatively independent from other soil nutrients

@hejcmanRengenGrasslandExperiment2007
- AIM: to test the long-term (64 years) effect of fertilisation on sward structure and floristic composition in low-productive grassland experiments
- Clear gradient with/without P fertiliser

  - without P fertiliser. supplementary differenciation depending on lime application & N
- Species associated with P treatment: *Poa trivialis*, *Poa pratensis*, *Rumex acetosa*
- Species associated with absence P: *Festuca ovina*, *Nardus stricta*, *Potentilla erecta*, *Anthoxantum odoratum*
- Decrease moss layer & species richness with increasing sward height

- AIM: to test 10-years effect of P and N on plant diversity, community composition & ANPP of native ungrazed tallgrass prairie burnt every two years
- Treatment x functional groups
  - N & N x year affected all functional groups -> strong decline perennial C4 & increase non-N-fixing perennial forbs
  - P affected perennial C4 grasses & non-N-fixing perennial forbs
  - P x year affected perennial C4 & annual C3 grasses
  - N x P affected perennial C4 grasses, non-N-fixing perennial forbs & annual forbs
- Biomass: 
  - N significantly increased ANPP, grass & forb biomass
  - no individual effect of P
- TAKE-HOME: effect nutrient on species composition N + P > N >> P

# FIRE EFFECT

@smitInteractionsFireHerbivory2019
- AIM: to review interacting effects of fire x herbivory

@bulanEffectsTwoAcute1971
- AIM: to test arthropod response to burning & mowing in oat fields
- Decrease of total arthropod density until after 6 months of the fire but beetle density not affected by mowing
- total insect biomass remained lower after burn, beetle following trend
- beetle species: some drastically reduced, and two others increased numbers after fire
- species/area diversity: decrease species/2.5 m2 stable till 6 months
- no change of equitability in beetle species
- species diversity herbivores below unburnt treatment, while trends not that clear for carnivorous
- Difference between burnt and unburnt treatments attributed to difference in energy supply and number of ecological niches

@forcePostfireInsectSuccession1981 [BOF]
- AIM: to assess postfire sucession of arthropods in Chaparral shrubland
- Decline in insect family diversity up to 3 years after burn

@pippinObservationsArthropodPopulations1996
- AIM: to assess the effect of large-scale La Mesa wild forest fire on arthropod
- More genera in the unburnt site
- Recolonisation mostly driven by insects with high mobility

@swengelLiteratureReviewInsect2001
- AIM: to review insect response to fire
- the Smaller plot and larger surrounding matrix of (longer) untreated habitat, the more the results of a management study relate to vegetative preferences rather than also reflecting direct effects during the treatment -> small-scale study would minimize direct fire impact

# MEASURING BIODIVERSITY IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES

@palmerSmallscaleEnvironmentalHeterogeneity1990
- AIM: to discuss a correction between observed species distribution in a quadrat, which has its own range of conditions, and the extrapolated distribution along the gradient

@kokEuropeanBiodiversityAssessments2020
- AIM: to review methodologies used to assess effect of livestock on biodiversity in Europe
- Scales of study: field > landscape > farm > genetic > field element
- Indicators according to organisation level
  - genetic: DNA, breeds, populations
  - species: 
    - abundance & richness - most commonly used, with focus on plants & within plants vascular. For arthropods, beetles, butterflies & moths most commonly studied, and within them Carabidae and dung beetles.
    - traditional diversity indices - Shannon index most commonly used
    - novel diversity indices - mean species abundance (= relative abundance of originally occurring species compared with undisturbed ecosystem), potentially disappeared fraction (= relative change in species richness compared with undisturbed semi-natural habitats), multidiversity (relative richness of multiple taxonomic groups)
    - composition & function: most studies used ordination (C-CA, NMDS), with i.e. Ellenberg indices for ecological niche, functional traits & diversity..., other used Community Specialisation Index (specialist vs generalist bird species)
    - qualitative scoring system: systems specific to each studies
  - landscape: structure & habitat: coverage by different height classes/plant categories; richness, abundance & Shannon index for land cover/land use types; spatial organisation landscape
- Summary impact livestock on biodiversity
  - 36% negative, 21% positive, 15% both, not applicable/neutral 26%
  - difference between food production function, where more intensive was never only positive, & conservation function, where almost half cases positive impact
- TAKE-HOME:
  - focus on direct effects, gap on indirect effects (feed, water use) -> life cycle approach pertinent, particularly under socio-ecological perspectives
  - when conservation approach, more relevant to evaluate the degree to which systems can be preserved -> thus novel indices
  - novel indicators with low cover in academic literature but already big impact in policy-making -> key to properly understand underlying assumptions for selecting appropriate indicators & make the right interpretation
  - seemingly validated concepts in relation to livestock impact: intermediate disturbance hypothesis & winner/loser species

@leprovostContrastingResponsesBelowground2021
- belowground diversity does not respond to land use intensity and change the same way as aboveground diversity. As conservative management decisions are taken in regard to aboveground diversity, it may not stimulate, if not even negatively affect belowground biota

@duelliBiodiversityEvaluationAgricultural1997
- AIM: to highlight challenge assessing local/regional biodiversity in agro-ecosystems & propose framework for standardised biodiversity estimates
- 3 types of comparison to assess biodiversity of an area
  - contribution to broader scale biodiversity - e.g. low-species rich mires but with high specialisation level which host rare red-listed species
  - comparison in space - to neighbouring sites/areas
  - comparison in time - long-term monitoring -> sensitive for sustainability
- measures of site-specific biodiversity
  - instead of more commonly used plant & birds, arthropods as surrogates -> contribute to 90% genetic variability
  - though warning towards "specialist-conservationist" perspective, with intensive research for exhaustive inventory -> may be interesting for national-wide biodiversity (e.g. rare species), but to date no "best correlating arthropod group in comparison with overall biodiversity in agricultural field/area"
  - widely used group is carabid beetles, but indicative value relatively weak as species number & distribution relatively similar across biotopes -> more accurate would be spiders & staphylinids
  - limit data collection - in terms of efficiency, 3 weeks in spring & 2 weeks in summer optimal -> for 1st period, a good indicator is one week after onset of full flowering *Taraxacum officinale*
- landscape mosaic pattern as surrogate for regional biodiversity -> equilibrium theory of island biogeography (biodiversity on inland positively correlated with island area & negatively correlated with distance to nearest continent)
  - limit of this approach in agricultural landscape - fragmentation & isolation seemingly not most limiting factors, but habitat quality
- mosaic concept for local/regional biodiversity, better suited than island biogeography
  - habitat variability - number biotope types per unit area -> the higher, the broader is spectrum of genetic pool
  - habitat heterogeneity - number of habitat patches & ecotone length per unit area -> biodiversity increases with number & size variation of patches, which also increases ecotones & edges
  - surface proportions natural, semi-natural & intensely cultivated areas
- TAKE-HOME: assessment regional biodiversity should rely on mosaic concept including all parameters

# RESEARCH PERSPECTIVES

@meuwissenFrameworkAssessResilience2019

## SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL APPROACHES

@wittmanSocialEcologicalPerspective2017
- AIM: conceptual model for the multi-scale assessment of farming systems based on a social-ecological approach of the rural landscape
- Landscape-scale 
  - particularly useful unit of analysis for understanding challenges related to biodiversity conservation & food security
  - pertinent for multi-scale analyses as shaped by ecological & social dynamics at both smaller scales (patches, households) & larger scales in which they are embedded (regions)
- Methodology: not so much indicators themselves, which are context-dependent, but rather the how & their spatial coverage

@balmfordWhatConservationistsNeed2012
- AIM: to encourage conservationists towards targeted issues related to agriculture to ensure limitation of impact - focus on broader scale, beyond the in-farm activity
- Five main topics
  - Understanding future demand -> even if a better control of waste & production efficiency was attained, agriculture is still likely to expand
  - Targeting research to the farm products that matter most -> particularly difficult for livestock (assessment less straightforward than for crops), but lack of knowledge of agroindustry & livestock intensive farming impact on the big picture
  - Quantifying trade-offs and synergies -> usual dichotomy land sharing vs land sparing, but need more wide-scale studies to decide what is best
  - Assessing which farming methods have greatest potential -> explore all alternatives across dogmas, from GMO to organic farming
  - Learning how to better integrate conservation and agricultural policy -> public regulation & planning

@sinclairOptionsContextApproach2019
- AIM: new concept of "option by context interaction" (OxC) for improving agronomic research by considering the real-world heterogeneity of farmer circumstances
- Initial assumption: "many factors that affect the suitability of agronomic innovations, such as soils, climate, farming practices, household characteristics, markets, social capital & policy implementation vary at fine scale"
- "When 'performance' is expanded to include the farmer's perspective, embracing impacts on the total factor productivity of their livelihood and the acceptability of proposed change in relation to their objectives, then the dimensions of 'environment' that matter also have to be expanded to include social and economic as well as ecological conditions"
- Research trend over time
  - 1990s: participatory research: high level of farmer participation but low number of contexts/participants
  - 2000s: precision research: high number participants but low level farmer participation
  - what we should aim for: high number participants and high level farmer participation
- Requirement: 
  - necessary to go beyond minimal variation as a target for integrating variation as the object
  - large number of contexts - need for prioritising which context factors & interactions most important to understand
  - participatory research - to address complexity farmer livelihood; ethical considerations
- Implications for reconfiguration research x development
  - participatory action research at large scale
  - crowdsourcing or citizen science
  - farmer research networks
  - research in development (nested-scale innovation, market interventions, policy & institutional reforms)

@deffontainesAgriculturalSystemsLandscape1995
- AIM: to investigate how landscape structure is related to farming system by comparing two models in Normandie & Lorraine
- TAKE-HOME: "We suggest that agricultural landscapes are better understood and modelled when farm structure and functioning is the starting point of the research"

## FARMER PERSPECTIVE

@robertProcessesAdaptationFarm2016

@nuthallIntuitiveWorldFarmers2012

@kvakkestadNorwegianFarmersPerspectives2015

@lutzFarmerCooperationMeans2017

@lamarqueHowEcosystemServices2014
- AIM: outcomes from a RP feedback game with farmers to explore how ES cognition mediates feedback from environmental change in farmers' behaviour in a mountain grasslands system
- Scenarios: drastic climate change & local socio-economic perspectives; intermittent (favourable conditions) & international; drastic anticipation with current socio-economic context
- Farmer knowledge
  - overall knowledgeable of the ES concept, & most ES known except nitrate leaching & carbon storage
  - recognition mutual interactions (e.g. plant diversity, flowering)
  - manuring: not associated with nitrate leaching but with increase forage quantity & quality
  - grazing: negative effects on aesthetics & plant diversity & decrease litter quantity
  - climate: influence rainfall, temperature & elevation on forage quantity
- Farmer values: forage quality > plant diversity > forage quantity > water quality > aesthetics > litter quantity > flowering onset > nitrate leaching > carbon storage
  - forage quality: desirable for herd welfare & parts of the herd with higher needs such as lambs or dairy cows
  - forage quality & quantity: contribution farm economy
  - plant diversity: contribution forage quality &/or aesthetics
  - litter quantity: variable, with positive short-term effect on vegetation regrowth (frost protection, fertilisation) but negative long-term effect with litter choking out vegetation & affects forage quantity & quality
- Farmers behaviours in scenarii
  - manuring: stopped in drastic-local, increased in intermittent-international & variable in drastic-anticipation
  - mowing vs grazing:
    - drastic-local: mostly grazing, with half farmers stopped mowing & engaged with fodder buying in winter
    - Intermittent-international: mostly mowing
    - Current practices: farmers organised their land management around spring grazing & mowing because summer alpine meadows large enough to ensure flexibility forage resources
- Contextual factors: constraints topography for mechanised mowing & manuring, economic (distance to farm)
- TAKE-HOME: 
  - some ES not part of farmer knowledge, thus by principle not considered, but institutional mechanisms (e.g. carbon credit) led some farmers to take it into consideration
  - some ES known but with low value or farmers considering not having enough knowledge to integrate them in decision-making: e.g. perceived influence mowing date on flowering onset (thus affecting forage quality & quantity) but did not consider themselves to adjust date for maximising ES delivery
  - some ES both knowledge & values, with reasoning on synergies & trade-offs between multiple ES: e.g. manuring first for forage quantity but also species diversity & forage quality
  - both direct & indirect feedback, with farmers adapting to familiar constraints (e.g. drought) but also new information (carbon credits)

@mcginlayThreatAbandonmentSocioecological2017
- AIM: to assess the risk of abandonment of high nature value grasslands in relation with farmer interviews
- Candidate availability: at most meadows, at least some degree of difficulty in recruiting & retaining farmers to undertake agricultural management operations because of 1) replacement for retirement & 2) ageing farmer population
- Farmers' perspectives on meadow value: 
  - highly variable, but generally acknowledged the validity of biological, cultural & landscape aspects of meadow value
  - most importance on agricultural value (hay quality/quantity)
- Barriers to farmers' agency in meadow management
  - restriction associated with agri-environment schemes (e.g. hay cut) usually associated with reduction hay quality
  - controversy about manuring, about which conservationists are critical but farmers attached for cultural (traditional) & productivity arguments
  - animal welfare & hygiene legislation which restrict the movement & mixing of cattle herds: financial + administrative barriers
  - management delivery models & compensation schemes
    - licensee: payment from farmer to landowner -> most common but also least beneficial for farmers
    - non-economic mutual arrangement, but no farmer benefice of agri-environment funding
    - bought-in contractor service -> the default option to respond to lack of candidates
    - owner-manager
- Profitability: only marginal with very unstable economic situation because of market prices

@ianniRevitalizingTraditionalEcological2015
- AIM: to investigate on the presence & evolution of TEK in a community of a World Heritage site in Italian Alps threatened by encroachment
- General ecological knowledge (assessed from plant species identification) limited in the community
- Negative trend of biodiversity-related knowledge transmission between generations
- Strong relationship between increasing disconnection (physical or psychological) & independence of livelihood from agricultural & wild systems & significant intergenerational losses of ecological knowledge -> loss of knowledge indicator loss of ecological control

@wehnAdaptiveBiodiversityManagement2018
- AIM: combining traditional ecological knowledge with scientific knowledge to assess the adaptative management approach of semi-natural hay meadows in Western Norway
- Norway's Action Plan for Hay Meadows - monitoring of biodiversity targets & introducing sustainable management of the most biologically valuable semi-natural hay meadows across Norway -> subsidies for the farmers when HBV + voluntary 5-10 years management plan following authorities guidelines
- Method
  - Social survey - farmer interviews about historical, floristic & ecological knowledge linked to hay mowing with ecologist & social scientists
  - Ecological survey 
    - all plant species, classified as TEK indicators, semi-natural specialists or neither
    - assessment of biodiversity conservation by management made on species assemblages & semi-natural grassland specialists
    - assessment of pertinence mowing time - phenological stages of TEK indicators & semi-natural specialists the week before mowing date
- objective 1 - Success of the APHM approach on the short-term
  - successful to involve land owners and managers (collaboration perspective)
  - but more limited in making farmer's point of view evolve -> farmers very attached to the "vision of a non-overgrown farm", which was the main reason of their collaboration, rather than the "diversification of the landscape"
  - no obvious positive effect of scheme, but prevented managements with potential negative influence (what the farmers would have done without APHM alternative)
- objective 2 - Revival of historical practices
  - big issue of fragmentation and concentration of hay meadows, due to loss of summer farming practices
  - most properties (10/14) without livestock, while combination of hay & livestock was typical of small-scale farming in Norway -> what the cut grass should be used for when there is no livestock anymore
  - strong reliance on pluriactivity = diversified incomes, which has impacted the use of specific material/facility for hay-cutting
- objective 3 - Long-term sustainability
  - although high species richness within the meadows, low turnover between them (meadows rather homogeneous) -> problem might be linked to fixed cutting dates, which are not part of traditional practices
  - ageing farming population, with not much potential for succession at all so even less for keeping traditional practices
- objective 4 - role of TEK in meeting ADHM goals
  - limited TEK (e.g. indicator species) of respondents, especially younger, though a 70y suggested the gap was already more than one generation ago
  - in absence of such knowledge, more difficult to involve farmers in the making of the management plan. But some farmers did develop "endogenous" knowledge through the management process
  - Still possible to use recorded TEK as indicators, but for biodiversity rather than agricultural production (historic use)
- TAKE-HOME: during threat to hay-meadows diversity & integrity due to ageing population and loss of traditional practices (missing market for hay) -> practices still pertinent from an ecological perspective, but do not address current socio-ecological conditions even if farmers are overall willingful. APHM has helped in the short term, but long term much more challenging

## TRANSDISCIPLINARITY

@lacombeDesigningAgroecologicalFarming2018

@altieriLinkingEcologistsTraditional2004
- AIM: review on traditional farming systems and linked agroecosystems that could feed ecological theories -> transdisciplinary research
- Smallholder knowledge and skill has developed by centuries of experience, without research, a way to self-sustain their communities while keeping high-biodiversity agroecosystem
- This farming could be used as models in this race for sustainable use of land -> need translation of principles into practical strategies for natural resource management
- Agricultural landscapes developing from indigenous knowledge are managed for different usages, so they are multifunctional by nature and allow local food self-sufficiency
- place-specific, co-evolution with nature and culture
- Similarities for most traditional agroecosystems:
  - high species number
  - high structural diversity in time and space
  - exploitation of the full range of local microenvironments
  - maintenance of closed cycles of materials and waste through efectice recycling practices
  - complex biological interdependencies, resulting in a high degree of natural pest suppression
  - dependence on local resources and human and animal energy, thereby using low levels of input technology and resulting in positive energy efficiency ratios
  - use of local varieties of crops, wild plants, and animals
- "Most farmers have an intimate knowledge of their surroundings, especially within a small geographical and cultural radius. This local expertise cannot be matched by the generalized knowledge of the ecologist, yet the ecologist's sophisticated training cannot be matched by the experiential knowledge of local farmers.
- What can ecologists lean from farmers
  - traditional farming systems usually mixed-systems with complex interactions between different ecological and human compartments -> great playground to understand processes of natural fertilisation, pest control (services)
  - higher productivity, stability and resilience of polyculture systems thanks to the mechanism of facilitation

# ECOLOGICAL METHODOLOGY

## STOCHASTICITY VS DETERMINISM

@conradiResourceAvailabilityDetermines2017
- AIM: to experimentally assess the effects of soil nutrient supply on niche-based selection vs stochasticity in determining species composition of early-successional temperate grasslands
- Alpha diversity: decreased across all treatments, but magnitude depended on intensity
  - smaller decrease under low & moderate nutrient supply
  - stronger decrease under high nutrient supply
  -> end experiment: alpha diversity low & moderate supply >* high
- Grass relative abundance increased over year with high supply
- Gamma diversity (overall species number across plots) low & moderate >~20% high supply
- Beta diversity -> contradictory results between indicators 
  - Jaccard's Index: increased (NS) over years with high supply -> composition should thus rather be driven by stochasticity or dispersal limitation rather than filtering
  - Raup-Crick dissimilarity (control for probabilistic sampling effect leading to high beta div values when alpha low): under high supply considerably more species than expected by random chance vs* low approached species number expected by random chance
- Processes
  - low supply: low temporal turn-over (Jaccard) but dissimilarities approached zero during succession -> turn-over most likely resulted from ecological drift
  - high supply: first stochastic assembly, then transition to selection-dominated system
  - moderate supply: intermediate temporal turn-over + slightly unimodal relationship dissimilarities with time, with as high alpha as low supply but increase grass abundance -> temporal turn-over driven by slow replacement of less competitive species
- TAKE-HOME: ecological succession in nutrient-poor grasslands mostly driven by stochastic patterns while nutrient enrichment imposed deterministic filter favouring species with greater ability for light competition

## SCALE

@cadotteDispersalSpatialScale2005
- mostly dispersal focused, so not most important now

@borcardDissectingSpatialStructure2004

@ettemaSpatialSoilEcology2002

@leiboldMetacommunityConceptFramework2004

@chanetonDisturbanceEffectsPlant1991
- AIM: to assess the effect of observational scale and level of species abundance hierarchy when studying both slow underlying disturbance (cattle grazing) and shock disturbance (flooding)
- Method
  - observational scale: stand (~1 ha) vs patch (~5 m)
  - dominance hierarchy: weighted richness dominants N2 (reciprocal Simpson) vs intermediate N1 (exponential Shannon) vs full N0 (species richness)
- Stand diversity
  - Dominance x grazing -> diversity higher in ungrazed but N2 sharper than N1 -> more dominance concentration under grazing
  - flood x grazing -> flood decreased richness in ungrazed, with sharper for N1 (intermediate species more affected), & increased in grazed, with a bit more for N2 (dominant species favoured) -> N1 richness similar for both grazing conditions after flood
- Patch diversity
  - Dominance x grazing -> N2 similar between grazing regimes, N1 ungrazed < grazed (less intermediate species in ungrazed), N0 ungrazed < grazed
  - flood x grazing -> decreased N0 & increased N2 for both grazing regimes, N1 decreased in ungrazed & increased in grazed
- Relationship N1 x sample length 
  - regression sharper (from lower div but gets higher) in ungrazed plots compared with grazed plots -> higher heterogeneity in ungrazed plots
  - when flood, regression ungrazed same as grazed
- TAKE-HOME: effect of disturbance & interaction between disturbances will vary according to grain of study and weighted diversity index

@brownImportanceScaleEvaluating1989
- AIM: to explore the importance of scale when assessing effect of herbivory on plants -> **un classique !**
- Scale of observation - already known processes change shape & interaction when observer moves along scale
  - Single plant - herbivory impact may be death, changes in resource or biomass allocation, photosynthetic rates, reproduction, morphology -> thus may impact competitivity of grazed plant against others
  - Community - three-ways interaction: plant diversity & sward structure constrain herbivory - community composition & structure constrain plant response to herbivory - herbivory constrain both individual plant & community
  - Environment - constrain grazer patterns/choices and thus indirectly affect community
- *"The time interval during which one chooses to make measurements and the frequency of measurements during the interval will determine the significance of what is perceived."*

@allenConfusionScaledefinedLevels1990
- AIM: to propose a new framework in order to isolate scale of observation from organisational levels -> **un classique pour expliquer la difference entre niveaux d'organisation du vivant et echelle**
- Organisational levels are not scale-dependent: what define them is not the size, but the relationship
- Thus unidirectional organisational scale not relevant to describe ecological complexity, as it only shows a very specific case which is far from being a general rule
- Background & foreground: rather than size/scope, thinking ecosystem fluxes of material & energy along time frame -> slower more widespread fluxes and processes are the context for more local processes with a short turn-over time
- Communities as "interference patterns of organism occupancy of euclidean landscapes over the short and the long terms" -> interference = pattern which emerges through interaction effects of two or more waves somewhat out of phase, usually because of slightly different periods in the separate waves
![](illustrations/Allen&Hoekstra1990_ScaleOrganisation.png)

@hustonLocalProcessesRegional1999
- AIM: to review/conceptualise variation of diversity according to scales of ecological processes
- main questions before considering local vs regional control of ecological patterns
  - what is the appropriate scale for seeing effects of local processes
  - how are regional processes manifested at the scale of ecological measurements
- assumption: patterns at large spatial scale result from regional processes, while patterns at small spatial scales result of either local or regional processes
- warning about the term "local" when defining large study area (e.g. 50 x 50 km) which by nature encompass heterogeneity at scale large enough to match with beta-div rather than alpha-div
- characterisation "regional" processes
  - effects of geophysical properties of a region (climate, geology, size, age) on ecological processes occurring at either local or regional scales
  - ecological or evolutionary processes (migration, invasion, extinction) that occur uniquely at regional scale
- limitation of species diversity
  - local extinction after disturbance, under low population growth rate likely to be induced by low productivity -> low end of productivity gradient
  - local extinction following competitive exclusion, under high population growth rate & few disturbances -> high end of productivity gradient
  - primary available regional species pool -> in-between of productivity gradient, where high variability of combination productivity x disturbance
- thus *warning extrapolation from local to regional* -> if any local sample at non-equilibrium conditions allowing high diversity, total species list will cover effect of local processes in other localities & lead to incorrect conclusion that regional influences are dominant over entire area
- TAKE-HOME - "any heterogeneity resulting from disturbances or variation in physical conditions will tend to obscure the negative effect of local processes on species diversity, and lead to the erroneous conclusion that local processes are unimportant for regulating diversity"

@denglerBiodiversityPalaearcticGrasslands2014
- Extremely diverse grasslands (particularly central Europe) can be explained by five preconditions: 1) Large evolutionary species pool; 2) Intermediate position along environmental gradients; 3) Landscape heterogeneity/mass effect; 4) Continuity of habitat patches in space and time; 5) Reduction of competitive exclusion
![](illustrations/Dengler.etal2014_ConceptScaleFiltersGrasslandFlora.jpg)

@siefertScaleDependenceVegetationenvironment2012
- AIM: to assess the effect of spatial extent and grain on the primacy of predictor variables on plant community composition
- Between the effects of fine-scale (e.g. edaphic) and broad-scale (e.g. climatic) factors on community data, the variance explained will depend differently on the extent and the grain of the survey. Fine-scale variation will be very high at small extent but will stabilize quickly on bigger areas, while broad-scale variation will be very low at first at increase with bigger extent. Both will decrease with higher grain, but it will be sharp and fast for fine-scale and slow for broad-scale. The influence of the latter can then be expected to increase with bigger spatial grain. There would then be a spatial grain threshold from which broad-scale variables take over fine-scale variables to explain species composition variance.
![](illustrations/Siefert.etal2012_ScaleExtentGrain_VarExp.jpg)
- New metric: multivariate effect size statistic MESS = average of correlation coefficients across multiple ordination axes, weighted by the amount of variance accounted for by each axis
- Predictor primacy - % most variance explained over total cases
  - Extent
    - <1 km^2^ (NS): / biotic (0) < 0% climatic & spatial (4) < 45% edaphic (20) < 50% disturbance (4) & topography (18)
    - 1-100 km^2^*: 0% biotic (8) & spatial (3) < 27% topography (15) < 33% climate (3) < 50% disturbance (10) < 57% edaphic (21)
    - 100-10 000 km^2^: 0% biotic (5) < 25% climate (8) < 29% spatial (14) < 33% disturbance (9) < 45% edaphic (29) < 53% topography (19)
    - >10 000 km^2^*: 0% spatial (4) < 8% topography (13) < 20% disturbance (10) < 36% climate (11) < 50% biotic (4) < 53% edaphic (17)
    - overall*: 12% biotic (17) < 16% spatial (25) < 27% climate (26) < 36% disturbance (33) < 37% topography (65) < 49% edaphic (87)
  - Grain

    - 200-1000 m^2^: 17% spatial (6) < 25% topography (16) < 36% disturbance (14) < 40% edaphic (25) < 57% climate (7) < 67% biotic (3)
    - >1000 m^2^: 0% biotic (7) < 25% spatial (8) < 29% climate (7) < 38% edaphic (16) < 43% topography (14) < 50% disturbance (8)
    - overall*: 12% biotic (17) < 16% spatial (25) < 27% climate (26) < 36% disturbance (33) < 37% topography (65) < 49% edaphic (87)
- Estimated extent threshold of 2000 km^2^ or 45 km linear distance -> from where plant distribution more likely to be explained by climatic factors (e.g. temperature) than edaphic factors (e.g. pH)


## DIVERSITY VS COMMUNITY COMPOSITION

@klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007
- variation partitioning more explanatory for species diversity than for species composition -> can be due to statistical method or actual complexity of community responses compared to diversity

## ECOLOGICAL PREFERENCES & TRAITS

@broseConsumerresourceBodysizeRelationships2006
- AIM: to investigate body size ratio of consumer vs resource across habitats and organisms
- across all habitats & predator types: linear increase predator mass with prey mass
- predator/prey body size ratio across habitats
  - freshwater > terrestrial or marine habitats
  - no *difference among invertebrate predators
  - invertebrate prey >* ectotherm prey for invertebrate, ectotherm & endotherm predators

@wongTraitBasedEcology2019
- AIM: to build an arthropod-related conceptual framework for ecological traits
- Environmental properties such as habitat openness and moisture should not be considered as traits, as they are not measured on the organism, but rather defined as "ecological preferences"
[NOT FINISHED]

## INDICATOR SPECIES

@tichyStatisticalDeterminationDiagnostic2006
- AIM: to compare and optimise fidelity coefficient phi and indval
- Phi correlation
  - Unlike Indval, Phi correlation coefficient depends on the size of the group, and an equalization step can be needed in case of different group sizes
  - Phi can be high for not very common species in target group if difference between relative frequency within and outside target group is large. On the other hand, if difference is small then even species with high frequencies in target group are given low phi values
- IndVal
  - Standard indval: very high weight to common species and lower weight to differences in relative frequency of species. But also possible to modify balance between fidelity and specificity
  - Unlike phi, no zero (when species frequency in target = in non target) and not possible to distinguish positive from negative fidelity 
- For small vegetation units of unequal size, equalized phi better characterised the vegetation units

## INSECT TRAPPING

@duelliBiodiversityEvaluationAgricultural1999

@shortEntomologicalCollectionsAge2018
- AIM: to list and describe available methods for insect data collection and evolution of the field with new technological advances

@bakerEvaluatingSpatialAutocorrelation2006
- AIM: tested for spatial autocorrelation and depletion within 99 m transects when using pitfall trapping for ground-dwelling arthropods
- Did not find spatial correlation within 99 m transects -> "beetle community dissimilarities were not consistently lower when traps were in closer proximity"
- importance to test for spatial autocorrelation on control site to validate the study design

@wardEffectsPitfallTrap2001
- AIM: tested trap spacing effect between groups with 1 m, 5 m and 10 m distance on ground-dwelling arthropod (all orders)
- No spatial depletion observed across treatments (no change in abundance)
- Difference in morphospecies richness for beetle between 1 m space and the other treatment, with rare morphospecies more affected
- No change in morphospecies composition. Change was explained by habitat factors and not trap spacing

@mommertzComparisonDVacSuction1996
- AIM: to compare sampling efficiency of D-vac, fenced and unfenced pitfall traps for beetles and spiders in agrosystem, with complementary lab experiment to compare activity and trapability of beetles from same genus
- D-vac overall with lower taxa number and abundance. D-vac samples dominated by Staphylinidae
- More individuals and higher biomass caught in unfenced compared with fenced traps -> bigger species more common in unfenced and smaller species most frequent in fenced. But overall result interpretation when comparing habitats no different
- In lab experiment, *Poecilus cupreus* more active and was caught quicker than *Poecilus versicolor*.

@schmidtCaptureEfficiencyPreservation2006
- AIM: to compare different pitfall trap liquids in specimen capture and preservation of ground-dwelling arthropods
- High evaporation rate of ethanol-based liquids
- Preservation specimens: pure water and ethanol-based with more damaged spider parts compared to salted water and ethylene glycol
- Catch numbers: overall arthropod abundance no different, but effect on spiders, springtails, dipterans & ground beetles. Number of ground beetle genera & spiders lower in salted water & ethanol-glycerin
- Hypothesis for difference in capture: specific gravity higher in salted water (SG = 1.18-1.20) which makes arthropod floating at the surface, and thus makes easier the escape of newly trapped individuals than can rest on them.
- Ethylene glycol recommended as non-volatile and preservative

@sunderlandDensityEstimationInvertebrate1995
- AIM: to review the different catching techniques to estimate the density of invertebrate predators in agroecosystems
- The most accurate term to characterize pitfall trap catches is "activity-trappability-density"
- Only "real" density estimation would be with a trapping web sampling design with concentric circles of traps at fixed distances from central point

@koivulaPitfallTrapEfficiency2003
- AIM: to investigate the effect of trap size, collection fluid and vegetation structure on Carabidae collection
- Fluid: ethylen-glycol more efficient
- Trap size: large traps collected more individuals
- Habitat type: difference in trappability of one species over four between clear-cut and forested stand, but no detected effect of surrounding field-layer vegetation

@wallinMovementsCarabidBeetles1988
- AIM: to study walking behaviour of different Carabidae species depending of the habitat and their feeding state
- Species would follow a correlated random walk in their preferred habitat (e.g. forest for *Carabus nemoralis* and *Pterostichus melanarius*)
- On the other hand, forest species would have a directed movement or burrowing activities in crop fields

@greensladePitfallTrappingMethod1964
- AIM: to test the efficiency of pitfall traps according to sampling setting and immediate surrounding in grass heath
- Traps with vegetation clipped 30 cm around captured overall more individuals than without clipping, but seemed to vary according to species
- Catching efficiency also could depend of litter depth, with catches of *Nebria brevicollis* diminishing with increasing litter depth (but not control experiment, so where is the trapping efficiency compared to the environmental preference?)

@melbourneBiasEffectHabitat2009
- AIM: experiment to test for vegetation structure effect within the immediate pitfall trap surrounding on ant catching
- Experimental design: non-modified, clearing of litter within 80 cm radius, clearing of all vegetation within 80 cm radius.
- Abundance: for 4 out of 5 common ant species, more specimens were caught when surrounding cleared, but some variations across species
- Relative abundance: for 3 out of 5 common ant species, effect of habitat structure. But no common trends and high variability between species responses.
- Occurrence frequency: overall 19 species, higher frequency with cleared habitat. 8 rare species over 10 (<10 occurrences) were only caught in cleared treatments.
- Species richness: higher in cleared treatments
- Community composition: clear and significant difference between non-modified and all-cleared treatments

@buchholzCoversInfluenceCapture2009
- AIM: to test whether the presence of roof affect the pitfall trap capture efficiency for different orders in grassland
- METHOD: 3 replicates for each treatment (not covered, white cover, green cover, black cover) on 14 x 14 cm lids on 5 grassland sites for 1 year (emptied once a month)
- No effect on species richness and abundance for both spiders & carabids
- No effect of roof on Carabidae species distribution, and no visible trend according to species habitat preferences (open vs woodland) contrary to spiders

@bellEffectsPitfallTrap2014
- AIM: bulding on from @phillipsEffectsHabitatStructure2005, to test the effect of lid transparency and habitat structure on catches of Carabid beetles in grassland
- METHOD: 3 treatments (opaque, semitransparent, transparent) on 15 x 15 cm lids + surrounding vegetation height effect (2.5 m radius) on 1 unique site
- EXP 1: 3 replicates for each treatment (only?) for ~15 days trapping -> 435 beetles
- EXP 2: 3 replicates for each treatment x surrounding vegetation height (0.5; 0.25; <0.1 m) for ~40 days trapping -> 1263 beetles
- Overall higher catch with higher transparency, but seems to differ according to vegetation height and beetle species
- Considering all species, trends are: no visible effect at low vegetation height, potentially lower efficiency of transparent at medium height, lower efficiency of opaque at high vegetation
- Different species response: *Agonum cupreum* with significantly less catches under opaque lids, while *Amara obesa* less affected overall and seemingly with higher catches under opaque lids

@phillipsEffectsHabitatStructure2005
- AIM: to test the effect of lid transparency and habitat structure on catches of Carabid beetles in regenerating stand of formerly clear-cut and burnt mixed boreal forest (trembling aspen ~2m height)
- METHOD: 3 treatments (opaque, semitransparent, transparent) on 15 x 15 cm lids + surrounding (2.5 m radius) vegetation height effect (2; 1; <0.1 m) on 1 unique site
- EXP: 3 replicates for each treatment lid x vegetation height for ~73 days -> 1216 Carabidae
- Temperature under roof significantly increased with lid transparency and with lower vegetation height
- Trends of higher catches of Carabidae with opaque lids with low surrounding vegetation, but not significant
- For two most abundant species, no effect either even if some trends of higher vegetation catch of *Sericoda quadripunctata* under opaque lids in low vegetation
- Significant vegetation effect (more Carabidae caught in lower vegetation) but no significant lid x vegetation effect
- Species composition affected by vegetation structure (high vs low & medium) but no effect detected of lid transparency

@baarsCatchesPitfallTraps1979
- AIM: to test pitfall trapping efficiency to capture beetle density on two model species & comparison square vs cup traps
- Close linear relationship between beetle density and year-round sampling for both species

@schirmelCaptureEfficiencyPitfall2010
- AIM: to determine how sampling interval (weekly, once every two weeks, monthly) affects efficiency of pitfall traps for different orders
- Number of catches significantly decreased with increasing sampling interval for Apidae, Araneae, Carabidae, other Coleoptera and Isopoda

@langeEffectPitfallTrap2011
- AIM: to compare efficiency of funnel vs conventional cups and diameter size on catches of Carabidae and spiders
- METHOD: 4.5 cm vs 9 cm diameter PVC traps, with and without funnel
- Carabidae abundance increased with size of trap and with use of funnel, but the number of species was not affected by any of this factor.
- Spider abundance (*) and species richness (NS) affected by trap size
- Cost-efficiency: better lower number of more efficient (bigger + funnel) traps.

@jansenHowManyVictims1979
- AIM: to model mathematically the capture of pitfall traps
- Model assumptions: 1) animals move independently (Brownian motions); 2) Boundary of pitfall act as absorbing or elastic barrier; 3) A fixed density of animals at t0 homogeneously distributed over finite area
- Model free parameters: 1) animal mobility; 2) animal reaction to pitfall trap; 3) initial density

@hohbeinPitfallTrapsReview2018
- AIM: building from @brownReviewExtensiveVariation2016 but with more literature resources, to review pitfall trap methodology and list differences in trap characteristics and sampling design
- Recommended standard design:
  - Nested design (funnel)
  - Diameter 9-11 cm
  - Transparent cup and funnel
  - Propylene glycol for preservation (non-toxic, contrary to ethylene glycol)
  - Transparent cover, 2-5 cm aboveground
  - Sampling intervals: 7 days or less
  - Trap distance: transect, every 10 m

@brownReviewExtensiveVariation2016
- AIM: to compare how different pitfall trap coloring (brown, green, white, yellow) affects arthropod catches from different orders
- Overall orders (NS): white > yellow > green > brown
- Significant difference for Apidae, Araneae, Carabidae & Diptera with more captures with white and then yellow traps.
