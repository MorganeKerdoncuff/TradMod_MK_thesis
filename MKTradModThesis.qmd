# Abstract in English

As scientific evidence demonstrates everyday the unprecedented environmental burden brought by agriculture worldwide, engaging research effort towards farming systems supporting agro-ecological diversity is an utmost priority. In Western Norway, agriculture is dominated by small-scale livestock production which has shaped semi-natural habitats of high ecological and cultural values across the whole fjord system. However the socio-economic decline of the countryside during past decades has led to concomitant trends of intensification on more fertile grasslands (infields) and abandonment of low-productive heathlands on the coast and in the mountains (outfields), increasing their vulnerability to environmental changes. In this context, the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (NBR) aims to be a model area for sustainable land use that would stem from past management practices while ensuring the farmer livelihood and the resilience of the food production system.

In this thesis I relied on an exploratory ecological survey on the grazing fields of the NBR, across the whole coast-to-mountain gradient, to examine the potential of different managements for ensuring the delivery of multiple ecosystem services and enhancing local biodiversity. More specifically I attempted to assess both the influence of environmental variation driven by the fjord system geophysical context (PII, PIII, PIV) and the effects of land use including stocking density (PIII, PIV), livestock type (PII, PIII) and rotational prescribed burning (PI, PIV) on diversity, composition and associated ecosystem synergies and trade-offs in outfields (PI, PIV) and infields (PII, PIII, PIV).

I confirmed that the regional-scale environmental variation reflected a hump-shaped productivity gradient that affected the land use (PI, PIV) and the landscape (PIII). However when focusing on more productive infields I found no direct effect of landscape zone (PII, PIV) or climate variables (PIII) on grassland diversity (PII, PIV), assemblage composition (PIII) or ecosystem services (PII, PIV).

Regarding field management, I emphasized the importance of maintaining low-intensive grazing on outfields that showed very high bryophyte diversity and better carbon sequestration potential compared with infields (PIV). On the coast, rotational prescribed burning was a valuable complementary practice to year-round sheep grazing as it favoured xerophilous and sun-loving beetles by locally creating new ecological niches (PI). In infields, livestock type affected plant functional group, with on average higher percent cover of grass when grazed by cattle (PII) and higher percent cover of bryophyte when grazed by sheep (PIII). On the other hand stocking density or fertilisation level did not seem to affect the current diversity, composition and structure of grassland assemblages (PIII, PIV), but the intensification trend may have led to infield homogenisation over time (PIV).

# Introduction - The role of Norwegian small-scale grazing systems in the current global food security challenge

Should we produce more to sustain more people on the planet? When facing the upcoming global food security challenge [@kastnerGlobalChangesDiets2012; @moraExploringFutureLand2020; @vanmeijlModellingAlternativeFutures2020], with a food demand expected to increase between 30% and 62% by 2050 [@vandijkMetaanalysisProjectedGlobal2021], the initial temptation to dive into a "crop-mania" has raised some warnings [@foleySolutionsCultivatedPlanet2011; @hunterAgriculture2050Recalibrating2017]. First, the prevalent issue is less a matter of gross production capacity than severe North-South inequalities in its redistribution and availability [@cassidyRedefiningAgriculturalYields2013; @fischerLandSparingLand2014; @tscharntkeGlobalFoodSecurity2012; @westLeveragePointsImproving2014]. Second, there is only very limited potential for the expansion of agricultural lands without conflicting with other land uses [@kimMappingEnvironmentalLand2018; @liSpatialConflictIdentification2023; @zabelGlobalAgriculturalLand2014] or damaging to a critical extent the biodiversity and functionality of natural and semi-natural ecosystems [@beckmannConventionalLandUse2019; @foleyGlobalConsequencesLand2005; @newboldGlobalEffectsLand2015; @newboldHasLandUse2016]. The livestock sector bears high responsibilities for the latter, as globalised grain-feed systems have steadily replaced pasture-based husbandry following the Green Revolution [@kastnerGlobalChangesDiets2012; @ramankuttyTrendsGlobalAgricultural2018]. This transition provided overall relatively poor return in calorie supply [@cassidyRedefiningAgriculturalYields2013] and economic profitability for the farmers [@garibaldiFarmingApproachesGreater2017; @jeanneretIncreaseFoodProduction2021], but was at the cost of massive land appropriation and severe environmental externalities in the Global South [@cunninghamCloseYieldgapSaving2013; @hongGlobalRegionalDrivers2021; @naylorLosingLinksLivestock2005] and of widespread decrease and degradation of global grassland area [@bardgettCombattingGlobalGrassland2021; @liuAnnualDynamicsGlobal2020; @piipponenGlobalTrendsGrassland2022; @wirseniusHowMuchLand2010], particularly sharp in Europe [@auneLossSeminaturalGrassland2018; @schilsPermanentGrasslandsEurope2022].

To shift away from this trajectory dramatically pressurising the Earth limits [@pelletierForecastingPotentialGlobal2010; @richardsonEarthSixNine2023], a new dominant paradigm has emerged during the past decade that acknowledges the synergy between food security, ecosystem integrity and people well-being and thus defends the potentiality of win-win alternatives [@fischerReframingFoodBiodiversity2017; @hanspachTradeoffsSynergiesFood2017; @wittmanSocialEcologicalPerspective2017]. These approaches have been declined across different concepts - e.g. agroecology [@holt-gimenezAgroecologyFoodSovereignty2012; @wezelAgroecologicalPrinciplesElements2020], diversified farming [@kremenDiversifiedFarmingSystems2012; @rosa-schleichEcologicaleconomicTradeoffsDiversified2019] or sustainable intensification [@prettySustainableIntensificationAgricultural2014; @rockstromSustainableIntensificationAgriculture2017] - that explore a wide range of management practices but share the consensus that food production should be diversified [@billenReshapingEuropeanAgrofood2021; @petersen-rockneyNarrowBrittleBroad2021] and tailored to the territorial context [@cunninghamCloseYieldgapSaving2013; @prettySustainableIntensificationAgricultural2014] to support self-sufficient and resilient socio-ecological systems [@chappellFoodSecurityBiodiversity2011; @gardnerAgriculturalResiliencePerspectives2019]. The realisation of this new agricultural pathway thus requires an extensive effort of trans-disciplinary and policy-oriented research experiments, that would explore ecological interactions and trade-offs under different farming systems [@egliWinnersLosersNational2018; @rockstromSustainableIntensificationAgriculture2017; @runhaarFourCriticalConditions2021].

In Western Norway, such opportunity has been offered through the UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserve [@unescoNewRoadmapMan2017], which supports the regional implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals by relying on wide-scale collaboration and knowledge-sharing between model areas disseminated all around the world [@barracloughGlobalKnowledgeAction2023]. As such, the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (NBR) was designated to "be based on the best from the past and [...] pave the way for a future-oriented societal development that ensures the sustainable use of all types of resources for the benefit and pleasure of both the present inhabitants and future generations" [@kalandNordhordlandBiosphereReserve2018]. Agriculture in the NBR indeed carries a strong legacy of low-intensive rotational grazing that have shaped a typical mosaic-like landscape hosting a remarkable biodiversity still unparalleled as of today [@austadHumaninfluencedVegetationTypes1991; @haugeGaldaneLaerdalWestern1988; @olssonAgroecosystemsNeolithicTime1991]. If the limiting landform and climate of the fjord system has prevented a too radical transformation of the countryside in comparison with the Eastern plains [@fjellstadPatternsChangeTwo1999], the rural communities still went through a lasting socio-economic decline leading to the intensification of fertile fields on one hand and the abandonment of remote, low-productive areas on the other [@forbordDriversChangeNorwegian2014; @hamreLandcoverStructuralChanges2007a]. As per the NBR objective, land planning for sustainable agriculture should therefore aim to 1) preserve the inherited ecological diversity associated with small-scale grazing and low-intensive management [@hamrePlantSpeciesRichness2010; @losvikHayMeadowCommunities1993] and 2) ensure the resilience and functionality of the agro-ecological system in face of upcoming global challenges such as climate change [@liuAssessingEffectsClimate2019; @meuwissenFrameworkAssessResilience2019]. However, despite its preponderance in the fjord landscape agriculture has so far received relatively low academic interest except when embedded in conservation research (but see for instance @wehnAdaptiveBiodiversityManagement2018), and extensive studies on grazed meadows particularly tend to be outdated (e.g. @losvikHayMeadowCommunities1993). The first stepping stone for coherent decision-making in the NBR management should thus be a comprehensive assessment of both the current ecological states of the NBR semi-natural habitats [@soliveresBiodiversityMultipleTrophic2016] and the direct and indirect benefits provided by the farmers activity [@bommarcoExploitingEcosystemServices2018; @goldsteinIntegratingEcosystemserviceTradeoffs2012].

<!-- The livestock sector holds key responsibilities as it accounts for the largest land use [@kastnerGlobalChangesDiets2012], global demand for animal products is still predicted to increase, even in the Global North [@alexandratosWorldAgriculture20302012], leading to further pressure over planetary boundaries [@newboldHasLandUse2016; @pelletierForecastingPotentialGlobal2010; @richardsonEarthSixNine2023]. Globalised grain-feed based systems have been growing relentlessly for the past 50 years following market demand, despite poor return in calorie and nutritional needs [@cassidyRedefiningAgriculturalYields2013; @ramankuttyTrendsGlobalAgricultural2018] and at the expense of severe environmental externalities mostly shouldered by the Global South [@cunninghamCloseYieldgapSaving2013; @hongGlobalRegionalDrivers2021; @jonesNutrientStrippingGlobal2013; @naylorLosingLinksLivestock2005]. In parallel pasture-based husbandry has either intensified or declined, leading to the decrease and degradation of global grassland area [@liNewGlobalLanduse2017; @liuAnnualDynamicsGlobal2020; @wirseniusHowMuchLand2010] and subsequent loss in productivity [@kwonGlobalEstimatesImpacts2016; @liuAssessingEffectsClimate2019; @piipponenGlobalTrendsGrassland2022], multifunctionality [@bardgettCombattingGlobalGrassland2021; @steffan-dewenterTradeoffsIncomeBiodiversity2007] and biodiversity [@newboldGlobalEffectsLand2015; @newboldHasLandUse2016]. -->
<!-- - such conversions sacrifice habitats of high conservation values [@bignalLowintensityFarmingSystems1996; @haladaWhichHabitatsEuropean2011]. As such, promoting pasture-based husbandry in the Global North would serve the complementary purposes of benefiting regional biodiversity while alleviating the crop burden of the Global South hotspots [@foleySolutionsCultivatedPlanet2011; @haberlQuantifyingMappingHuman2007; @kehoeGlobalPatternsAgricultural2015; @zabelGlobalImpactsFuture2019]. -->

## On labelling farming systems...

Characterising farming systems in an accurate and reproducible way is an everlasting challenge but nevertheless necessary to identify trade-offs brought by existing models in order to sort the wheat from the chaff. Since the environmental footprint of agricultural production became a burning topic, many different terms have been used usually to draw opposition between the intensive, industrialised model that became predominant in the Global North, usually branded as "conventional", and the more ecology-friendly farming qualified as "organic", "alternative" or "traditional" for the most famous [@sumbergWhatConventionalAgriculture2022]. However, most of them lack of meaningful conceptual definition: if organic farming is usually associated to regulated labels that allow a clear dichotomy based on well-defined parameters such as fertilisation or stocking density thresholds, "conventional" refers to what is common or generally in use in a certain place and at a certain time. Thus by essence "conventional" farming can vary a lot depending on countries and epochs, as for instance what can be currently described as "traditional" used to be "conventional" practices. Similarly, "traditional" farming is a very fuzzy concept that mostly refers to a socio-cultural context usually dated from before the Green Revolution and more or less arbitrarily associated with low-intensive management [@plieningerTraditionalLanduseNature2006]. 

In this thesis, "traditional" was used only when describing formerly common practices that have either severely declined or disappeared over time and are thus nowadays associated with the cultural heritage [@daugstadAgricultureUpholderCultural2006]. Instead I decided to characterise the NBR grazing system as "small-scale", which does not relate to specific production principles but to either spatial extent (up to 10 ha according to the @faoSmallholdersFamilyFarmers2013) or socio-economic status [@jouziOrganicFarmingSmallscale2017], and can therefore be more pertinent for comparative studies and wide-scale assessments [@ricciardiHowMuchWorlds2018]. 

- has been used in Norwegian policymaking [@asheimPolicyMeasuresPreserve2020]

I acknowledge that the terminology "small-scale" grazing is still lacking in the sense that it can encompass many different models and thus may not reflect as accurately the evolution of agriculture in the NBR. I therefore encourage further discussion as part of the NBR management plan to determine specific terminology for the past, current and predicted stages of farming in Western Norway that will facilitate policy-making in the future [@gillerFutureFarmingWho2021; @huberFarmTypologiesUnderstanding2024].

# Aim of the thesis

This PhD thesis aimed to investigate how management practices and fjord environmental context affected the diversity, functionality and associated ecosystem services of the NBR grazing fields. As we wanted to provide a preliminary base of scientific knowledge that would guide and support decision-making in the NBR, we relied extensively on the ecosystem service framework that has grown familiar among the population and has been widely used for policy-oriented concepts (e.g. multifunctionality, see @bjorkhaugMultifunctionalAgriculturePolicy2008 and @wilsonWeakStrongMultifunctionality2008). Considering the limited scope of our ecological survey and the inherently high variability associated with the fjord geophysical context and the NBR small-scale grazing system, we took an explicit exploratory approach that relied on multiple indicators of ecological diversity and functioning (@tbl-papersummary).

Following the coast-to-mountain gradient, we investigated:

- the effect of rotational prescribed burning on beetle diversity and ecological preferences by comparing active assemblages on pioneer and mature heath in a coastal heathland grazed all year round by Old Norse sheep (PI);
- the influence of livestock type (sheep, cow, goat) and landscape zone (coast, fjord) on the delivery of agronomic services in semi-natural grasslands by using indicators of nectar and forage resource based on plant functional traits (PII);
- the cross-scale interactions affecting the composition of these same semi-natural grasslands by testing correlations between sets of variables characterising fjord climate, landscape composition, grazing management, fine-scale environment and dominant grass, forb and beetle assemblages (PIII);
- the ecosystem services trade-offs and synergies provided by different land uses (infield, outfield) by assessing the aboveground and belowground productivity, the biodiversity and the carbon sequestration potential of grazing fields along the whole coast-to-mountain gradient (PIV).

# Study context - The fjord, the farmer and the farm

## The landform and climate of the NBR fjord system

Fjords are *"steep-sided, coastal erosional troughs which have been inundated by the sea"* [@howeFjordSystemsArchives2010] that originate from the ice retreat after the last glaciation [@mangerudIceflowPatternsPrecise2019] and interconnect into an intricate "fjord system" network which spatial cohesion decreases with the intensity of erosion processes towards the sea [@nesjeFjordsNorwayComplex2009]. The NBR, embedded between the Bergen municipality in the South and the longest and deepest Norwegian fjord, the Sognefjord, in the North, stretches from the North Sea to the eastern Stølsheimen mountains and thus offers a valuable insight of this coupled elevation and connectivity gradient (@fig-mapcontext), which can roughly be divided into three main zones [@kalandNordhordlandBiosphereReserve2018]:

  (1) The **coastal area**, parceled into numerous and relatively flat islands and peninsulas. The warm and moist air masses brought by the Gulf stream buffer temperature annual variation and offer a mild oceanic regime, with average summer temperature between 13°C and 15°C and annual precipitation around 1300 mm.
  (2) The **fjord area**, where land pieces progressively merge into coherent blocks made of narrow valleys and sharp mountain sides that dive into the fjord arms. Climate grows colder and wetter inland following the elevation gradient, with an increase of temperature range and a 3000 mm peak of average annual precipitation at mid-elevation on westerly exposed slopes.
  (3) The **mountain area** above the tree line and made of plateaus ranging from 400 to 1300 masl. The highest elevations have a drier and colder subpolar climate, with a mean annual precipitation of 2000 mm and less than 3 months in a year where the average temperature exceeds 10°C.

These changes in landform and climate are associated with a hump-shaped productivity gradient that displays very different landscapes between the extremes, the outer coast and mountain area, essentially characterised by shrub-dominated communities and poor edaphic conditions with alternating exposed bedrock and mires (PI), and the more central inner coast and fjord area, which encompass arable lands, semi-natural grasslands and shrublands, as well as large forest cover on the mountain slopes (PIII) (@fig-landscape). The landscape is particularly diverse in the central region as the heterogeneity of fjord shape, direction, width and steepness creates complex local dynamics [@nesjeFjordsNorwayComplex2009]: for instance, the North-facing slope of a fjord arm can still be covered by snow while its South-facing counterpart has already entered spring bloom. These cross-scale environmental processes that are unique to the fjord region have constrained the development and evolution of agriculture over time, by limiting the use of machinery and the conversion of grazing lands into arable lands and thus preventing a too severe degradation of the agro-ecological system [@forbordDriversChangeNorwegian2014].

## The Nordhordland farm through history

The first signs of agricultural activity in Western Norway draw back to early Neolithic, with the introduction of burning [@hjelleLongtermChangesRegional2018; @prosch-danielsenPalaeoecologicalInvestigationsReconstruction2000] and domestic grazing [@hjelleHesitantHuntersReview2006; @mehlCulturalLandscapeDevelopment2015a] that drastically expanded the area of heathland on the coast (PI). By middle Neolithic grazing management had reached the fjord and mountain areas, and by late Neolithic cereal cultivation had also spread in the more fertile, inner regions [@hjelleHesitantHuntersReview2006]. The initial hunter-fishers had thus progressively settled into fisher-farmers (*fiskarbonde*), who still depended from both sea and land resources to ensure their livelihood. It is during the Iron Age that the "traditional" small-scale farming of Western Norway, which legacy has lasted till the present days, reached its maturity [@olssonAgroecosystemsNeolithicTime1991]. To overcome the high discrepancy in land productivity, fisher-farmers relied on a mixed crop-livestock system where low-productive outfields (*utmark*) were grazed and/or mowed and more productive infields (*innmark*) were cultivated, with manure and mulch transferred from the former to the latter for soil enrichment [@austadHumaninfluencedVegetationTypes1991; @indrelidFarmingSystemIts1988] (PIV). This complementary management shaped the agro-ecological landscape into a fine mosaic of small, pluriactive family farms [@hetlandPluriactivityStrategyEmployment1986; @jonesLandtenureLandscapeChange1988], which would typically encompass a few arable lands, several patches of more or less productive semi-natural grasslands for rotational grazing and/or hay-making and some forested areas for building and fire wood [@austadHumaninfluencedVegetationTypes1991; @haugeGaldaneLaerdalWestern1988]. The large remote areas of heathlands on the coast and in the mountains were used as outfields only, with year-round grazing combined with rotational prescribed burning for the former [@hjelleLongtermChangesRegional2018; @lundbergAustevollChangingCoastal1991] and summer sheep transhumance for the latter [@indrelidFarmingSystemIts1988; @potthoffChangeMountainSummer2004]. Fisher-farmers therefore used of the whole coast-to-mountain gradient to create a spatially and temporally dynamic system of energy flows from the outer areas to the inner areas that has durably imprinted the fjord landscape (@fig-succession) and had promoted the highest level of biological and cultural diversity still as of today [@olssonAgroecosystemsNeolithicTime1991].

![Landscape succession on the coastal area, from the outermost heathlands (*lynghei*) to the innermost semi-natural grasslands (*innmark*). Source: @brekkeKulturhistoriskVegbokHordaland1993](illustrations/NBR_FieldSuccession.png){#fig-succession}

After WWII, Norwegian agriculture went through a rationalisation process which transformed the farm structure and management, with a decline of the owner-occupier model in favour of land renting and the creation of public incentives towards specialisation [@dramstadTenancyNorwegianAgriculture2010; @forbordDriversChangeNorwegian2014; @jonesLandtenureLandscapeChange1988]. Livestock was shifted to more productive infields which were enlarged and improved with the introduction of artificial fertilisation (PIV) [@fjellstadPatternsChangeTwo1999], while more remote outfields were progressively abandoned [@hamreLandcoverStructuralChanges2007a] along with their associated management practices such as summer farming [@olssonLandscapeChangePatterns2000], rotational prescribed burning (PI) or heath scything [@lundbergAustevollChangingCoastal1991]. These concurring processes were further aggravated by the socio-economic decline and the population ageing of rural communities [@forbordDriversChangeNorwegian2014], and have led to a drastic decrease in farming activity: nationally, the number of holdings dropped from around 200,000 in the 1950s to less than 38,000 in 2023 [@StatisticsNorway2024], with a bigger impact on small structures (<10 ha) which represented 90% of total holdings in 1949 against 53% in 1995 [@fjellstadPatternsChangeTwo1999; @ovreasEndringarJordbruksarealOg2011]. In Western Norway, this change was reflected across the whole fjord system with the encroachment of coastal and mountain heathland [@brynImpactsLandUse2012; @olssonLandscapeChangePatterns2000] and the impoverishment and coarsening of the infield landscape matrix [@hamrePlantSpeciesRichness2010; @norderhaugBiotopePatternsAbundance2000]. In a comparative study between cadastral maps of 1865 and 2002 in a locality along the Sognefjorden, @hamreLandcoverStructuralChanges2007a showed a 87% decrease of open habitat patches in activity, with half of the semi-natural grasslands abandoned over time, and the concurring loss of four out of five original man-made structures (e.g. stone wall).

To counteract this steady degradation of the countryside, policymakers have reflected on a new farming pathway that would not only be bound by market demand but would also consider food security, the preservation of the environment and the development of rural areas [@bjorkhaugMultifunctionalAgriculturePolicy2008; @romstadMultifunctionalAgricultureImplications1999; @ronningenLegitimacyMultifunctionalAgriculture2004] the same way as described by the multifunctionality concept promoted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [@oecdMultifunctionalityAnalyticalFramework2001]. Western Norway holds high potential for experimenting such transition thanks to the diversity of farm models according to the different livestock types, with on one hand beef and dairy farming rather associated with bigger and more intensive structures while sheep and goat husbandry tends to rely on more extensive management [@asheimPolicyMeasuresPreserve2020]. If the economic viability of the former essentially depends on the meat and/or milk production, the latter benefits more from additional cultural values associated with "traditional" breeds, like the Norwegian old sheep (*Gammel Norsk Sau*), or practices, such as the small-scale goat cheese production in mountain summer farms [@daugstadAgricultureUpholderCultural2006]. Investigating these different production systems with trans-disciplinary research and optimising their distribution across the territory through the reorientation of public subsidies are crucial steps for the sustainable transition of agriculture in Western Norway [@asheimPolicyMeasuresPreserve2020].

<!-- - If public subsidies have multiplied since the 1970s to support agriculture at the national, county and municipality levels, the most important ones (e.g. Area and Cultural Landscape support) tend to neglect the environmental component [@asheimPolicyMeasuresPreserve2020]. - In present days, family farming is poorly viable and many households combine agricultural activity with full-time jobs in closest urban areas [@hetlandPluriactivityStrategyEmployment1986]. -->
<!-- - Changing perspectives & policies: change in agricultural policies towards farmer as independent entrepreneur in post-productivist context -> diversification of agriculture in activities beyond conventional farming [@daugstadAgricultureUpholderCultural2006] -->

## Ecological survey in the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve

The following survey design was used and adapted accordingly in papers II, III and IV, paper I relying on an independent methodology. It relied on three main factors that guided the distribution of our study sites in the NBR (@fig-sitemap):
  (1) the environmental gradient, based on the landscape zonation from @uttakleivLandskapskartleggingNorgeLandscape2011 We defined three main regions: the coastal area, the fjord area which encompassed the outer fjord and inner fjord zones (@fig-mapcontext B), and the mountain area.
  (2) the field type according to the infield/outfield terminology, that reflects habitat inherent productivity and associated managements. We relied on the "areal type" AR5 classification system developed by the Norwegian Institute for Bioeconomy (NIBIO) [@ahlstromAR5Klassifikasjonssystem2019] that describes infields (*innmarksbeite*) as "*agricultural lands that cannot be harvested mechanically* \[with\] *at least 50% of the area* \[...\] *covered with cultured grass or pasture-tolerant herbs*". Outfields were designated under the "open permanent lands" (*åpen fastmark*) category, briefly defined as "*areas that are neither a bog, agricultural, forest or infrastructure*" (PIV).
  (3) the livestock type, namely sheep, cattle and goat, which relates to current farm models in infields. Preliminary information on the farm management was retrieved from a socio-economic survey conducted in the NBR in 2018 [@reiersenBaerekraftVestnorskLandbruk2019].

We visited a total of 44 sites (@tbl-siterepartition): outfields were sheep-grazed heathlands located in the outermost part of the coastal area (5), in former forest clearings in the fjord area (1) and in the mountain area (6); infields were grazed by either sheep (11), cattle (10) or goat (9), and were located only in the coastal (14) and fjord (16) areas. The sampling period ranged from mid-June to mid-August 2019 and 2020, with coastal sites visited in early season, fjord sites in mid-season and mountain sites in late season to account for the timing difference of the spring bloom.

On each site we delimited a sampling area of 400 m^2^, preferably 20 x 20 m but otherwise 40 x 10 m, that was representative of the visited field and avoided exposed rocks, waterlogged ground, trees and field edges. We set a nested sampling design made of three plots of 3 x 3 m, separated from each other by at least 6 m and divided into nine quadrats of 1 m^2^, either dedicated to non-destructive (5) or destructive (4) sampling (@fig-sampling). In the non-destructive quadrats, we recorded the percent cover (0.01-100%) of vascular and bryophyte species (PII, PIII, PIV). In the destructive quadrats, we collected: plant aboveground biomass, within a 0.25 m^2^ subquadrat (PIV); a soil core of 10.5 cm diameter and 12 cm height for mesofauna extraction (PIV) and soil chemical analyses (PIII, PIV); three soil cores of 3.7 cm diameter and 10 cm height for bulk density (PIII); ground-dwelling beetles with a dung-baited pitfall trap of 10.5 diameter and 11.5 cm height left on site for a week (PIII); soil resistance to penetration by dropping a sharpened metal rod of 43.4 cm length, 2.2 cm diameter and 1.3 kg weight from 1 m above ground through a PVC tube to ensure vertical fall. The whole sampling process, except beetle trapping, was cleared within a day for each site.

When relevant, this field collection was completed with publicly available data on plant traits (PII) or climate and land cover (PIII). We also conducted a farmer survey by phone interviews between October 2021 and January 2022 to retrieve more information on the livestock and field management (@tbl-fieldmanagement). Unfortunately these data were not included in the statistical analyses (except in PIII) because of missing respondents (six farmers did not reply to the survey) and uneven accuracy in the information provided (e.g. not all farmers could provide an amount per surface of fertiliser sprayed), but were nevertheless used for general context and posthoc verification of odd values (PIV).

To the farmers' knowledge, which could go as far back as the 1920s, the large majority of our sites have been uninterruptedly grazed for the past decades and the few abandonment periods, when occurring, did not exceed 3 years. Infields were smaller areas, with half of the sites under 3 ha, while outfields could expand over more than 1000 ha in the mountain sites co-managed by several farmers. Half of the farms managed less than 25 animals, three-quarter less than 50, and only two outfields and three infields exceeded 80 head. The grazing period in infields was very variable, ranging from 2 to 12 months, while outfields were clearly split between mountain sites only grazed during summer and coastal sites grazed all year round. Almost all infields were enriched at least occasionally: 20 out of 27 respondents sprayed artificial fertiliser, among which 11, mostly cattle-grazed, also used manure and 5 compensated soil acidification with a mixture of shell with sand or lime. Mulching was not particularly common, and only two farmers used herbicides on their fields. Except for one site drained in 2010, the most impactful practices on soil (drainage, plowing) and vegetation (resowing) have not been used for at least the previous 20 years. Some outfields were managed to prevent encroachment by either rotational burning (3 coastal sites) or tree cutting (1 coastal and 1 mountain sites).

# Main results - Comparing grazing managements under the fjord system umbrella

<!-- Two major features stand out when describing small-scale grazing in the NBR [@kalandNordhordlandBiosphereReserve2018]: first the very unique context of strong West-East environmental gradient created by the fjord system [@ketzlerClimateNorway2021; @nesjeFjordsNorwayComplex2009], and second the diversity of farming practices between and within farms [**ref bouquins Inger**], both in a relatively limited geographical area. As such, the leading direction of our survey revolved around questioning the influence of the underlying regional gradient and of the different types of grazing management on the biodiversity, the functionality and the ecosystem services of the NBR grazing fields. -->
<!-- - We originally did not aim to investigate environmental variability within the NBR agro-ecological landscape in our survey, and as such our methodological design was undoubtedly lacking to address this purpose [**ref book heterogeneity ch.2**]. -->
<!-- - Nevertheless, such processes were expected to influence organism and ecosystem responses to grazing management and could not be overlooked [@habelEuropeanGrasslandEcosystems2013]. -->
<!-- - This chapter reviews how we approached ecological gradients either as constraining (PI), underlying (PII, PIV) or structuring (PIII) at different spatial scales and resolution levels (@tbl-envsummary), and how they related to grazing management. -->

## Accounting for the climate-landform gradient of the fjord system

The combined climate-landform gradient of the NBR fjord system can be seen as an overarching umbrella of inherent regional patterns constraining (1) habitat productivity [@knappRainfallVariabilityCarbon2002; @ritterDistinctResponseGross2020; @sloatIncreasingImportancePrecipitation2018], (2) species distribution according to their phenology [@abarcaDirectIndirectEffects2021; @bykovaTemperatureDependenceReproduction2012; @loganTemperaturedependentPhenologyPredation2006; @michaletzDriversTerrestrialPlant2018] and biotic interactions [@klanderudImportanceBioticVs2015; @olsenFacilitationCompetitionTemperature2016], and (3) land use [@haugeGaldaneLaerdalWestern1988; @hjelleHesitantHuntersReview2006].

(1) Site productivity was as expected a strong factor of variation of soil nutrient cycling [**ref**] and plant functional group diversity [@bakkerHerbivoreImpactGrassland2006; @debelloGrazingEffectsSpecies2007; @lezamaVariationGrazinginducedVegetation2014], but higher heterogeneity amongst outfields was seemingly not related to geographical location (PIV) despite sharp differences in temperature and precipitation between the coast and the moutains [@meteorologiskinstituttNorskKlimaservicesenter2023]. Climate effect could be buffered by the high in-field heterogeneity of outfields [@negronConsequencesIntensiveGrazing2019], with similar mosaic of ecological conditions met at both ends of the gradient through for instance topographic complexity [@graaeStayGoHow2018; @mysterudEffectsDensitySeason2007], grazing [@augustineFeedbacksSoilNutrients2003; @hopcraftHerbivoresResourcesRisks2010] or concurring management practices such as rotational prescribed burning on the coast (PI).

(2) When only considering infields, we did not find any effect of the landscape zone on vascular plant species richness (PII), but the relationships with assemblage and functional trait composition were not as straightforward. If we found signs of potential influence of the regional gradient over plant (PII, PIII) and beetle (PIII) assemblages as well as forage indicator value (PII), there were either contradicted by complementary analyses (PIII) or dependent on the interaction with the livestock type (PII). Even though temperature and precipitation can affect both plant [@reitaluDeterminantsFinescalePlant2014; @turtureanuScaleTaxondependentBiodiversity2014; @zelnikPlantSpeciesDiversity2013] and animal [@dauberLocalVsLandscape2005; @filazzolaEffectsLivestockGrazing2020] diversity and assemblage composition in grazing fields, regional phenomena may have weaker influence over shorter geographical ranges compared with grazing management or edaphic variables [@siefertScaleDependenceVegetationenvironment2012; PIII]. Local weather and topography could still indirectly affect plant species composition [@andersonRainfallSoilsModify2007] by constraining livestock foraging behaviour [@hesterForagingBehaviourSheep1999; @mysterudEffectsDensitySeason2007] or nutrient and water distribution [**ref**], but it was not verified in our survey (PIII).

(3) We found on the other hand a clear correlation between the climate-landform gradient and the land cover surrounding infields (PIII), supporting that the agro-ecological landscape matrix in the NBR fjord system is strongly environmentally constrained [@lundbergAustevollChangingCoastal1991; @nesjeFjordsNorwayComplex2009]. However, this change in landscape composition did not affect finer environmental gradients [**ref**] neither dominant plant [@cousinsModellingEffectsLandscape2003; @soderstromPlantsInsectsBirds2001] or beetle [@avironCarabidAssemblagesAgricultural2005; @bataryResponsesGrasslandSpecialist2007; @martelImpactFarmingSystems2019] assemblages (PIII). If the influence of landscape is not always verified compared with local variables [@dauberLandscapeStructureIndicator2003; @jeanneretQuantifyingImpactLandscape2003], other features than composition can be more significant such as connectivity [@concepcionEffectsLandscapeComplexity2008; @cousinsHotspotsAreGone2008; @schweigerQuantifyingImpactEnvironmental2005], heterogeneity [@burelDifferentialResponseSelected2004; @dramstadIntegratingLandscapebasedValues2001; @zulkaSpeciesRichnessDry2014], configuration [@lecoqLandscapeStructureInfluences2023] or complexity [@cloughFieldSizesFuture2020; @gonthierBiodiversityConservationAgriculture2014].

- Undoubtedly, the regional climate-landform gradient of the NBR fjord system alters organism responses to grazing management by interacting with local factors (PII, PIV) [**ref**], but our ecological survey had a too narrow scope to offer a proper assessment of these relationships.

- A major shortcoming comes from the overall poor understanding of the complex climate-landform gradient specific to fjord systems, regarding both its direction and scalability.
- If temperature, precipitation and elevation broadly follow a linear West-East gradient, habitat productivity is constrained into a hump-shaped pattern by both the oceanic and alpine regimes, thus mismatching "conventional" climate-elevation models.
- Most research emphasis on fjord systems has been on marine and aquatic biology, land-sea interface

- constraining habitat productivity at both ends by oceanic and alpine regimes and thus mismatching with more conventional climate-elevation models in continental settings.

- Main shortcomings: the unidirectionality, accurate characterisation of environmental gradients and the scale
- Lacking research
- Another layer of complexity is added by the fjord arms
- At local scale, the geomorphological complexity also shapes a network of micro-climatic niches [@graaeStayGoHow2018] 

Finally, paper III was our modest attempt to disentangle the effects of environment- and livestock-driven variation on plant and beetle assemblages across scales, which, unlike in other papers, were characterised by selected sets of measured variables. Even if we could only take an exploratory approach due to the limited scope and replication level of our study, this latter paper addressed the most explicitly the complexity of assessing grazing management effect within a highly heterogeneous system.

- At local scale, the geomorphological complexity also shapes a network of micro-climatic niches [@graaeStayGoHow2018] 
- threshold (proposed 45 km linear distance) beyond which plant distribution more likely to be explained by climatic factors than edaphic ones @siefertScaleDependenceVegetationenvironment2012
-	Local environmental variables: light, temperature, continentality & moisture unimodally associated with species richness [@reitaluDeterminantsFinescalePlant2014]
- Extent and grain are both important features which can alter final results.
- @nogues-bravoScaleEffectsHuman2008 strong effect of spatial extent, but not spatial grain, on species richness distribution along elevation gradient

## Characterising grazing management in small-scale grazing systems

- 

- If both papers suggested that grazing management had an influence on plant species composition, with different vascular plant species composition in sites grazed by cows (PII) and a significant correlation between grazing management and dominant grass communities in infields (PIII), it is difficult to assure that grazing itself is actually the direct driver.
-  First of all, the relationship between dominant grass species and the set of grazing management variables in paper III was supported in the first step by the canonical correlation analysis, but not by the subsequent redundancy analysis.
- Then, in paper II, if a different plant species composition was associated with cow-grazed infields, it does not mean that cows themselves were the driver of change.
- Indeed, we recorded from the farmer interviews (data not available at the time of PII submission) that cow fields were more heavily fertilised than fields grazed by other animals.
- Thus, on outfields which are less intensively managed, role of grazers maybe more prominent
- [PIV findings, with outfields vs infields]
- Habitat productivity is an important element [@milchunasQuantitativeEffectsGrazing1993], with potential interactions with grazers [@lezamaVariationGrazinginducedVegetation2014]
- In paper II, coastal fields grazed by sheep had lower fodder productivity (PII)
- on low-productive coastal heathland, combination of grazing and fire did influence beetle activity even at fine-scale, even if it did not seem to fundamentally modify the community

- stronger responses of herbage production & plant community structure to grazing intensity in highly productive mesotrophic grasslands compared to more species-rich ones [@isselsteinEffectsLivestockBreed2007]

- N fertilisation affect plant species composition [@klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007]
- mites & to lesser extent collembola most abundant in acidic soils with low nitrate concentration [@birkhoferGeneralRelationshipsAbiotic2012]


#### Depends on biodiversity attribute

- 3 primary attributes of biodiversity are composition, structure & function @nossIndicatorsMonitoringBiodiversity1990

species richness x community composition
- in wet Moliniea meadows different drivers plant species richness (soil > climate > topography > management) & composition (elevation > pH > flooding frequency > temp > mowing date > humidity > precipitation > P > N) [@zelnikPlantSpeciesDiversity2013]
- in Mediterranean grasslands, plant species diversity differed between low, moderate & high grazing intensity while community composition only differed in high intensity [@skornikEffectGrazingPressure2010]
- variation partitioning more explanatory for species diversity than for species composition -> can be due to statistical method or actual complexity of community responses compared to diversity [@klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007]
- landscape elements more influential on community composition of ground & dung beetles than species diversity [@soderstromPlantsInsectsBirds2001]
- contrary to species richness, most community structures (plants, beetles, butterflies) driven along infield tree cover gradient & % arable fields in landscape [@soderstromPlantsInsectsBirds2001]
- Carabidae species diversity responded to sheep & goat grazing intensity while community composition primarily responded to elevation gradient (0-2200 m) in Mediterranean shrubland [@kaltsasGroundBeetlesRespond2013]
- big shift in community composition may have only little effect on richnesss, evenness & diversity [@avolioChangesPlantCommunity2014]
- beetle and spider community composition responded to fertilisation in subalpine meadow but not species richness [@lessard-therrienImpactsManagementIntensification2018]

Diversity vs abundance
- only ground beetle abundance clearly responded to sheep grazing intensity in upland grasslands [@pozsgaiGrazingImpactsGround2022]  
- low grazing intensity decreased Shannon & Simpson diversity but increased abundance & biomass in comparison with 15y abandonment & moderate grazing [@tonelliEffectsProgressiveAbandonment2018]

Diversity indexes (alpha vs beta vs gamma)
- alpha diversity of semi-natural grasslands increased with proportion & diversity of natural & semi-natural habitats in the neighbourhood, while beta & gamma diversity increased with proportion & diversity of non-natural habitats [@janisovaLandscapeEffectsDiversity2014]

Functional vs taxonomic diversity
- functional diversity more temporally stable than taxonomic diversity under increasing grazing intensity, but still affected when intensity high in environments with limiter water availability @carmonaTaxonomicalFunctionalDiversity2012
- grazing intensity directly influenced both taxonomical & functional richness in sub-alpine & alpine grasslands, but not functional dispersion or evenness [@komacFunctionalDiversityGrazing2015]
- effect continuous vs late grazing mostly reflected in functional diversity of arthropods rather than species richness [@lenoirEffectsTimingGrazing2010]
- distribution of CSR strategies primarily affected by grazing intensity in Canadian marshes & wet meadows [@teuberLivestockGrazingIntermountain2013]
- area of historically preserved species-rich grasslands in the landscape affected arthropod species richness but did not filter specific traits [@woodcockHistoricalLocalLandscape2021]
- morphological traits, particularly linked to dispersal, good indicators of species responses to management intensity at both local and landscape scales [@neffCrossscaleEffectsLand2019]
- species & functional diversity highly (+) correlated in alpine Mediterranean grasslands [@catorciEffectsGrazingVs2014]

- species density & biomass in meadows do not respond to the same predictors [@graceRelationshipSpeciesDensity1999]


#### Depends on taxa

Plant vs arthropod
- plant richness more sensitive to local management intensification than invertebrates & vertebrates, while the latter significantly correlated with landscape complexity contrary to the former [@gonthierBiodiversityConservationAgriculture2014]
- no correlation between species richness of ant, wild bee & vascular plant when assessing for influence landscape matrix on grassland diversity [@dauberLandscapeStructureIndicator2003]
- no significant correlation between plant & ground beetle species richness in light cattle & sheep grazed calcareous grasslands [@lyonsImpactsContrastingConservation2017]
- plant & ground beetle community response to grazing management significantly correlated but not strongly enough to be considered as proxy in light cattle & sheep grazed calcareous grasslands [@lyonsImpactsContrastingConservation2017]
- different taxa (butterflies, carabids, plants) preferentially responded to different landscape features [@weibullSpeciesCompositionAgroecosystems2003]
- some common driver of diversity (e.g. vol juniper shrubs for butterflies, bumblebees & dung beetles, or number tree species for plants & dung beetles) and community composition (e.g. % arable fields in landscape for vascular plants & dung beetle, tree cover for vascular plants, dung beetles & ground beetles) [@soderstromPlantsInsectsBirds2001]
- landscape matrix effect NS for plants but had effect on ants through % forest & fallow lands, and on wild bees through % arable lands [@dauberLandscapeStructureIndicator2003]
- plant & spider species richness showed opposite response to land use, nitrogen content & moisture, with spiders favoured by fallows & plants more diverse in meadow & pasture [@bucherBiodiversityLowintensityPastures2016]

Arthropod vs arthropod
- only Coleoptera abundance/richness showed positive to negative responses to grazing against no grazing or grazing intensity increase while Orthoptera, Lepidoptera, Hemiptera & Aranea abundance/richness only showed neutral to positive responses in sheep-grazed grassland meta-analysis [@scohierHowSheepAffect2012]
- both spider & ground-beetle abundance & community composition responded to fertilisation on sub-alpine meadow but ground-beetle community more site-specific than spider [@lessard-therrienImpactsManagementIntensification2018]
- epigeic & grounw-dwelling arthropod diversity responded differently to vegetation clipping but both assemblage composition were driven by light incidence & average humidity in sandy mixed-grass prairie [@pratherPlantsRegulateGrassland2019]
- leaf-hopper more sensitive to low-intensive grazing vs no grazing than ground beetle or spider in alkaline meadows & steppe [@tormaDifferencesArthropodCommunities2023]
- Auchenorrhyncha most sensitive taxa to local & landscape management compared with Heteroptera & Orthroptera [@neffCrossscaleEffectsLand2019]

Aboveground vs belowground
- Belowground multidiversity (bacteria, fungi, nematodes) not affected by mixed cattle-sheep grazing against single, while aboveground & total multidiversity were [@wangDiversifyingLivestockPromotes2019]
- belowground diversity does not respond to land use intensity and change the same way as aboveground diversity. As conservative management decisions are taken in regard to aboveground diversity, it may not stimulate, if not even negatively affect belowground biota [@leprovostContrastingResponsesBelowground2021]
- Belowground multidiversity less affected by land-use intensification or interannual variation [@allanInterannualVariationLanduse2014]

Multidiversity
- multidiversity response to increasing land use intensity differs according to taxonomic groups [@allanInterannualVariationLanduse2014]
- only insect abundance showed significant responses to farming intensity & landscape complexity, while overall abundance following the same trends [@gonthierBiodiversityConservationAgriculture2014]

Functional type
- different responses of bryophyte & lichen richness to humus content, & vascular & lichen to micro-relief [@turtureanuScaleTaxondependentBiodiversity2014]
- vascular & cryptogams responding differently to elevation and soil nutrient/LOI [@austrheimPlantDiversityPatterns2002]
- change in plant species composition under rotational cattle grazing not detected when overall community considered but still significant for mesotrophic, oligotrophic & thermic groups in subalpine & alpine meadows [@perottiYearRotationalGrazing2018]
- tall annual & perennial grasses decreased with cattle grazing intensity while annual thistles (chardons) & crucifers increased in Mediterranean meadows [@sternbergVegetationResponseGrazing2000]
- all arthropod feeding guilds positively affected by % historically preserved species rich grassland in landscape either independently or with interaction [@woodcockHistoricalLocalLandscape2021]


## What has not been considered

- the scale of influence - common issue between PI & PIII, that maybe the scale was not appropriate (too small) to understand the mosaic & heterogeneity patterns -> might have needed to level up to field (PI) or farm (PIII) level
- the heterogeneity/patchiness within the field -> feeding behaviour depends on sward height [@wallisdevriesForagingStrategyCattle1994], size [@hesterForagingBehaviourSheep1999]
- isolating grazing management from the rest might not be the most accurate, as farming practices of small-scale grazing systems are very diverse and complementary
- the complexity of summarising broad-scale phenomenon by a few factors -> landscape only reduced to % cover, missing landscape complexity feature

div-hetero relationship
- heterogeneity as a response was not truly investigated
- the relationship diversity-heterogeneity to be more considered because not straightforward -> @lundholmPlantSpeciesDiversity2009
- at the field level, positive HDR represented by tree/shrub cover for plants & beetles [@soderstromPlantsInsectsBirds2001]


### Literature

#### Scale explanatory

- in species-rich grasslands, biodiversity driven by combination of cross-scale factors: large evolutionary species pool; intermediate position along environmental gradient; landscape heterogeneity/mass effect; continuity of habitat patches in space and time; reduction of competitive exclusion [@habelEuropeanGrasslandEcosystems2013]
- influence landscape drivers depends on scale of study, but this interaction also depends on taxa (influence factor grows/decreases with spatial scale) [@steffan-dewenterScaledependentEffectsLandscape2002]

- predictor influence depends on scale, though land use found as most important from 0.1 to 100 m^2^ range [@turtureanuScaleTaxondependentBiodiversity2014]
- different responses of alpha, beta, gamma diversity [@austrheimPlantDiversityPatterns2002], with mismatch between gamma and alpha diversity -> "area effect"
- 2 main landscape features which affect fundamental ecological processes [@dunningEcologicalProcessesThat1992]: physiognomy (spatial arrangement) & composition
- assessment regional biodiversity should rely on mosaic concept including habitat variability (number biotope types per unit area), habitat heterogeneity (number of habitat patches & ecotone length per unit area) & composition [@duelliBiodiversityEvaluationAgricultural1997]
- Between the effects of fine-scale (e.g. edaphic) and broad-scale (e.g. climatic) factors on community data, the variance explained will depend differently on the extent and the grain of the survey. Fine-scale variation will be very high at small extent but will stabilize quickly on bigger areas, while broad-scale variation will be very low at first at increase with bigger extent. Both will decrease with higher grain, but it will be sharp and fast for fine-scale and slow for broad-scale. The influence of the latter can then be expected to increase with bigger spatial grain. There would then be a spatial grain threshold from which broad-scale variables take over fine-scale variables to explain species composition variance. [@siefertScaleDependenceVegetationenvironment2012]

- Temporal variation of overall LUI better predictor of multidiversity than variation of individual LUI component [@allanInterannualVariationLanduse2014]

@scherrerDisentanglingProcessesDriving2019

#### Scale response

- response of native plant species richness to grazing intensity consistent across scales, but response to lower vs upper slope was scale-dependent [@dorroughPlantNeighbourhoodLandscape2007]
- better explained variance of plant diversity by experimental (grazing intensity, sward height) & soil (soil P & K) at patch scale compared with plot scale (0.5 x 0.5 m) [@tonnGrazingInducedPatchiness2019]
- plant richness response to grazing along elevation gradient depends on scale of observation (species-area relationships) [@debelloGrazingEffectsSpecies2007]

# Methodological perspectives - Considering heterogeneity and spatial scale in a complex feedback interactive system

- The first feature standing out from the description of small-scale grazing systems in the NBR is the high level of both *inherent* and *induced* heterogeneity [@fynnManagingBrowsingGrazing2019].

Finally, paper III was our modest attempt to disentangle the effects of environment- and livestock-driven variation on plant and beetle assemblages across scales, which, unlike in other papers, were characterised by selected sets of measured variables. Even if we could only take an exploratory approach due to the limited scope and replication level of our study, this latter paper addressed the most explicitly the complexity of assessing grazing management effect within a highly heterogeneous system.


## The context

- The absence of control can be debated whether our results 

- gradient of intensity -> usually intermediate disturbance the most beneficial for biodiversity
- though we saw variables respond differently 
- studies on grazing, particularly in small-scale or low-intensive farming systems, very often conservation-focused -> diversity/richness, rare species. Less on community or production focused

- grazing mitigating ecosystem functionality between aboveground and belowground compartments see @bardgettHerbivoremediatedLinkagesAboveground2003

### Literature

- grazing and spatial heterogeneity [@adlerEffectGrazingSpatial2001]
- usually positive heterogeneity-diversity relationships [@lundholmPlantSpeciesDiversity2009]
- sward diversity in experiment increases herbage quality [@jerrentrupDiverseSwardsMixedgrazing2020]
- Annual herbage accumulation not affected by species richness [@seitherSwardCompositionGrazer2012]
-	Species richness and phylogenetic diversity negatively associated in dry calcareous grasslands [@reitaluDeterminantsFinescalePlant2014]

- @tonnGrazingInducedPatchiness2019 heterogeneity (patchiness) driven by low-intensity grazing more important in preserving plant species diversity than intensity itself
- grazing by native grazers enhances plant species richness & heterogeneity of plant community on the long-term [@bakkerDoesResourceAvailability2003]
- overall positive effect of grazing (against no grazing) on plant species richness, but more important at high-productivity [@lezamaVariationGrazinginducedVegetation2014]
- grazing reduced cover of dominant species, particularly in high-productivity sites [@lezamaVariationGrazinginducedVegetation2014]
- decrease species richness with native ungulate exclusion [@andersonRainfallSoilsModify2007]
- higher water-holding capacity, soil nutrients and organic matter content in cattle-grazed savanna compared to abandoned [@augustineFeedbacksSoilNutrients2003]

- landscape intensification did not obviously affected multidiversity (small mammals, birds, insects & plants) [@burelComparativeBiodiversityGradient1998]

## What we did

- Different response variables -> diversity (PI, PII), community (PI, PIII), functional types (PI, PII, PIII)
- Different habitats -> outfields (PI, PIV), infields (PII, PIII)
- adaptation to environment -> gradient of intensity & active modification of the habitat -> range of possible managements (PIII) from the more passive (PIII) to the more active (PI)


## What we found

- weak but significant synergy between plant species richness & nectar value, and between nectar & forage values in infields (PII)
- hints of grazing effects on infields, but yet to show the exact mechanism
  - no direct correlation with plant communities but potential influence through fine-scale environment (PIII)
  - effect of animal partially supported with different vascular plant composition under cows (PII)
  -> take-home - there is probably something but maybe not correct variables (PIII) or enough replicates (PII, PIII)


### Literature

Methodology x categorisation
- landscape influence on plant, birds & arthropod richness depends on the features, metrics & resolution of the classification [@baileyInfluenceThematicResolution2007]

Diversity x productivity
- sward diversity in experiment increases herbage quality [@jerrentrupDiverseSwardsMixedgrazing2020]
- higher nutritive value of herbage in more diverse swards in experiment [@seitherSwardCompositionGrazer2012] 
- different nutrient uptake according to functional group [@chanetonNitrogenPhosphorusCycling1996]: forb shoots with high nutrient content under grazing while graminoid shoots with 3-5 times lower nutrient content under grazing
- decline orgranic matter digestibility & crude protein over season in diverse-oriented system while stable in production-oriented system in mountain meadows [@farruggiaAnimalPerformancesPasture2014]
- response of species richness to herbivory primarily affected by change in species dominance independently of productivity [@koernerChangeDominanceDetermines2018]
- neutral to positive effect of herbivory on species richness even at low productivity, & positive effect increase with productivity [@koernerChangeDominanceDetermines2018]

Soil
- fine-scale effect depends on functional types [@austrheimPlantDiversityPatterns2002] -> e.g. vascular and cryptogams were inversely correlated to soil nutrients and LOI -> negative for former, positive for latter
- light availability & heterogeneity may be bigger drivers than N concentration [@bakkerDoesResourceAvailability2003]
- N fertilisation affect plant species composition [@klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007]

pH
- mites & to lesser extent collembola most abundant in acidic soils with low nitrate concentration [@birkhoferGeneralRelationshipsAbiotic2012]
- Norway as the country with lowest average soil pH in agricultural & grazing lands due to predominance acid crystalline rocks & absence carbonate rocks + cold climate [@fabianGEMASSpatialDistribution2014]
- low pH decreases P mineralisation rate -> lower P availability for plants [@frankUngulateTopographicControl2008]


## What has not been considered

- fine-scale heterogeneity with its own temporal and spatial dynamic
- in-field patchiness of vegetation structure with different grazing capacities created by cattle grazing [@gilhausCattleForagingHabits2014]
- spatial heterogeneity from the bite to the landscape scale created by grazer at both individual and group levels [@parsonsSpatialHeterogeneityGrazing2003]
- e.g. seasonal variability of soil moisture & inorganic N [@ryelTemporalDynamicsSoil1996]

- temporal dynamic not really taken in account, especially to consider functionality of ecosystems -> e.g. only one-week sampling for beetles (PIII), one-day sampling for site productivity (PIV), agro-services calculated from databases (PII)
- the diversity of practices (and land use history, which can be very influential), is what make ecological studies difficult -> contrary to more normative/regulated systems, there is no general rules for fertiliser use for example. Each farmer will do what he thinks is best without relying on particular guidelines
- the difficulty of characterising functionality
- Feedback - very difficult to take in account, but nevertheless omnipresent are the feedback between grazer/field/plants, farmer/grazer/field and plant/plant/community [@brownImportanceScaleEvaluating1989]
- plant-plant & soil-plant interactions - complex organism-environment feedback hard to identify in ecological surveys but yet essential to understand ecosystem dynamics [@reynoldsSoilHeterogeneityPlant1997]

- the pattern/behaviour of grazers -> we looked at effect of environment on temporally fixed variables & on plants, but we did not look at the grazing behaviour under different conditions [@brownImportanceScaleEvaluating1989]

- different types of measurements -> we mostly considered taxonomic responses, and the only functional response (PII) was calculated from species & databases. Though grazing has much impact on plant phenology, morphology & physiology [@brownImportanceScaleEvaluating1989]

- the overall & indirect effects of farmland practices (not just direct grazing effect), by using for example life cycle approach, especially when perspectives are socio-ecological [@kokEuropeanBiodiversityAssessments2020]

### Literature

Scale
- primacy ecological processes into driving plant trait assembly varies across spatial scales: habitat filtering prominent at plot scale (2 x 2 m) but shift to limiting similarity at finer scale (20 x 20 cmm) independently of species richness and elevation gradient [@scherrerDisentanglingProcessesDriving2019]
- land use & edaphic variables with considerably more explanatory power of plant species community variation at coarse grain (50 x 50 m) compared with fine grain (1 x 1 m) [@raatikainenImpactsLocalRegional2007]
- discontinuity framework [@nashDiscontinuitiesCrossScale2014]
- common issue in multi-scaled studies: arbitrary choice of scale [@dixonhamilCrossscaleContradictionsEcological2016; @nashDiscontinuitiesCrossScale2014]

Historical imprint
- semi-natural grassland species richness & density more affected by 100y landscape connectivity than present one [@lindborgHistoricalLandscapeConnectivity2004]
- we did not take in account land use history @perringGlobalEnvironmentalChange2016 or past landscape connectivity
- past land use can be more important than current land use at explaining variation in functional diversity of mutualists & herbivores as well as multi-taxa mobility traits - field age particularly increase multitrait diversity for all taxa & for herbivores [@leprovostLanduseHistoryImpacts2020]

Forage quality
- seasonal variations also impacts nutrient concentration within plant biomass [@kleinebeckerEffectsGrazingSeasonal2011]
- year-round grazing can lower biomass nutrient concentration and thus fodder quality for livestock [@rupprechtEffectsYearroundGrazing2016]
- forage quality of 6 common forage species affected by sward diversity & livestock type [@cuchillohilarioForageSelectivityCattle2018]

Grazer driven heterogeneity
- different utilisation of forage resources according to livestock type & density of animals [@grantControlledGrazingStudies1996]
- importance of both individual determinism & social interactions within flocks for foraging strategies [@parsonsSpatialHeterogeneityGrazing2003]

- multidiversity and multifunctionality highly correlated with each other, but correlation increase as number of functions & trophic levels do [@wangDiversifyingLivestockPromotes2019] -> but in the case of exhaustive inventory, which is not the norm
- warning towards "specialist-conservationist" perspective, with intensive research for exhaustive inventory -> may be interesting for national-wide biodiversity (e.g. rare species), but to date no "best correlating arthropod group in comparison with overall biodiversity in agricultural field/area" [@duelliBiodiversityEvaluationAgricultural1997]
- belowground soil bacteria richness with the strongest positive effect on most functions [@wangDiversifyingLivestockPromotes2019]
- similar trends plant species diversity with functional trait diversity under different grazing animals [@tothLivestockTypeMore2018]

- Many studies only rely on species richness as a proxy for diversity [@lundholmPlantSpeciesDiversity2009] despite its limitation

- effect of grazing & interaction with other disturbances on diversity will depend on the grain of observation & the level of dominance [@chanetonDisturbanceEffectsPlant1991]


# The take-home from the thesis - From the summary concept

## What has not be taken in account enough

- Scale & representativity - we considered mechanisms acting at very different scales, from nutrient cycling in the soil to big climatic gradients, with a single observational scale (field-level) and low number of replicates
- Feedback - very difficult to take in account, but nevertheless omnipresent are the feedback between grazer/field/plants and farmer/grazer/field [@brownImportanceScaleEvaluating1989]

## Perspectives for the Biosphere Reserve

### Reconciliation human and nature

- A lot of land sharing research is focused on the Southern hemisphere, less in the North (e.g. @ranganathanSustainingBiodiversityAncient2008; @steffan-dewenterTradeoffsIncomeBiodiversity2007)
- smallholders emphasize the positive effects of small-scale farming on local communities, economy & cultural landscape -> different perspectives between the full-time "historical" farmer (National farmer organisation) and the part-time who includes broader perspectives (National smallholder association) [@daugstadAgricultureUpholderCultural2006]
- Sustainable production systems -> "diverse, synergistic and tailored to their particular social-ecological contexts" [@prettySustainableIntensificationAgricultural2014]
 

### Perspectives for farmers

- addressing the environmental & spatio-temporal variability not only pertinent for ecological perspectives in increasing understanding of agricultural systems, but also for farmers as it impacts the **functional resource heterogeneity**, which represent the *probability of meeting the specific nutritional needs of a grazing or browsing ungulate over time* [@fynnManagingBrowsingGrazing2019]
- not only "alternative" systems aiming for a more sustainable agriculture are hard to classify due to the extensibility and malleability for farmer's own interpretation, but there is also a lack of knowledge regarding the extent of use of non-certified practices which make it even more difficult to assess their impact on biodiversity and system functioning [@milderAssessmentMultifunctionalityAgroecological2012]

- not yet enough research on grazing systems ? At the end of the day, the end goal is to provide managers/farmers with concrete recommendations to ensure productivity, resilience and ecological preservation. The complexity of environmental variation coupled with management practices is already a lot, but coupled with farmer's commitment and freedom is even more challenging [@briskeRotationalGrazingRangelands2008]

- mixed grazing (sheep with cattle) on improved pasture increased lamb live weight [@fraserAlternativeUplandGrazing2013]


### Perspectives for conservation

- heath habitats, particularly in uplands, very important for carabid diversity conservation [@eyreRelationshipBritishGround2003]
- importance of maintaining ecological gradients even at fine scale to satisfy needs of different taxa -> e.g. soil humidity (+) vascular diversity but (-) wild bees diversity [@dauberLandscapeStructureIndicator2003]
- mosaic-like landscape with well preserved vegetation patches best for biodiversity conservation [@konigGetLargerGrow2019]


### Perspectives in ecological research

- still much research to be done on the effect of grazing & its different parameters on agricultural habitats at different spatial scales [@rookMatchingTypeLivestock2004]

- long-term changes in grazing and burning management at local scale may have broader consequences through how they affect carbon and nitrogen pool [@connellThreeDecadesDivergent2020]

- warning with definitions of communities, with desirable or not species -> not anchored in space & time -> definition @allenConfusionScaledefinedLevels1990
- more focus on arthropods more relevant [@duelliBiodiversityEvaluationAgricultural1997]
- different species richness in beetle families according to land use type [@dauberLocalVsLandscape2005]
- beetle families do not respond equally to environmental factors

- a key asset of Nordhordland Biosphere Reserve agricultural landscape is its mosaic-like heterogeneity. Though we touched on the mosaic effect at the field-scale (ref ØY) and we considered landscape as a variable (ref fjord), we never actually analysed the landscape mosaic [@duelliBiodiversityEvaluationAgricultural1997]. Landscape-scale studies would be complementary to field-scale studies and would allow an interesting approach on farm multifunctionality beyond ecological perspectives only.
- farm level as an interesting scale, as it encompasses socio-ecological processes, multifunctionality -> particularly difficult to isolate individual grazing practices from the rest of management

### Literature

- effectiveness of EU agri-environmental schemes (AES) dependent on landscape complexity [@concepcionEffectsLandscapeComplexity2008]
- "landscape-wide patterns of field size are linked to patterns of land ownership & to land management" [@cloughFieldSizesFuture2020]

Upscaling to farm level
- "We suggest that agricultural landscapes are better understood and modelled when farm structure and functioning is the starting point of the research" @deffontainesAgriculturalSystemsLandscape1995

Landscape research
- importance of habitat connectivity in comparison with management intensity still overlooked, and relationship between the two not straightforward -> the NBR landscape as a "model" mosaic-like agro-ecological landscape would be a good resource to investigate & provide suitable base for modelling [@grashof-bokdamGreenVeiningLandscape2005]

## Transdisciplinary research

@herreroFarmingGeographyNutrient2017

- socio-ecological approaches to investigate synergies between food security and biodiversity conservation @bommarcoExploitingEcosystemServices2018; @fischerLandSparingLand2014; @geertsemaActionableKnowledgeEcological2016; @hanspachTradeoffsSynergiesFood2017
- implementation of sustainable farming practices allowing long-term preservation of resources and ecosystem services requires broadening scale (landscape) @geertsemaActionableKnowledgeEcological2016
- need to dig further into the context-specific effect of management practices on different aspect of farm sustainability to identify trade-offs & determine optimal strategies @germanRelationshipsMultipleAspects2017

- trans-disciplinary approaches integrating livestock production & product valorisation (whole-chain) [@farruggiaAnimalPerformancesPasture2014]

- participatory approach needed to assess and ensure resilience of food system of local communities @menconiRevisitingGlobalFood2022

- @prettySustainableIntensificationAgricultural2014 Perspectives for concrete implementations of sustainable agriculture
  - both scientific & farmer input into technologies & practices which combine crops & animals with appropriate agroecological & agronomic management
  - creation of novel social infrastructure which both results in flows of information & builds trust amongst individuals & agencies
  - improvement of farmer knowledge & capacity through the use of farmer field schools & communication technologies

- @rockstromSustainableIntensificationAgriculture2017 livelihood-centered paradigm for sustainable intensification entails trans-disciplinarity & solution-oriented knowledge generation combining academic & practical knowledge through co-design & co-development of research
- @altieriLinkingEcologistsTraditional2004 Traditional small-scale farming systems all around the world could serve as models for developing new sustainable pathways. Ecologists have a role here to dissect the processes and feedback between farmers and agroecosystems so they can be translated into practical guidelines and policies for sustainable food production and land management.
- @altieriLinkingEcologistsTraditional2004 There is a complementarity between the long-term, empirical
- Farmer knowledge is specialist to the area, but "trans-disciplinary" in the practice. Ecologist knowledge is generalist, theory-based, more comprehensive in terms of underlying processes, but the approach is more narrow, discipline-based
- @foleyGlobalConsequencesLand2005 There is increasing need for both cross-disciplinary and trans-disciplinary research to develop and implement targeted policies for sustainable use of the land which would address short-term human needs, long-term preservation of ecosystem services and resilience of anthropogenic systems.
- @wehnAdaptiveBiodiversityManagement2018 different visions of the farmer and the ecologists -> they can agree for a common management (e.g. APHM) but for different reasons -> failure of the scheme to bring farmers and scientists on the same perspectives. Also limited traditional ecological knowledge of farmers, which limits their participation/incentives in the making of a management plan, though such management plan can encourage the building of "endogenous knowledge" (**thus key to build endogenous knowledge**). Such schemes should engage actively farmers and be flexible (e.g. hay-cutting time) to encourage experimentation even if it looks like a "bad idea" from first glance
- Increase of complexity of land management arrangements between farmers [@dramstadTenancyNorwegianAgriculture2010] which may challenge coordinate management measures according to common scheme.
- interdisciplinary research -> needs common reference frame (common definition & understanding of concepts) [@dramstadIntegratingLandscapebasedValues2001]

- "agriculture multifunctionality" has been widely used at the macro-scale of policy-making (national, EU), to the point where the meaning has been twisted to accommodate economic view of commoditisation, while exploring the pathways and interactions at the farm-scale would provide more direct and concrete insights by engaging concerned actors and tailoring to their needs and their environment [@wilsonWeakStrongMultifunctionality2008]

# Conclusion

- The aim of this survey was to provide an overview of the diversity offered by the grazing systems of the NBR.
- Thus, we explored different aspects of managements and ecological responses.
- Due to the limited scope of our ecological survey, and its subsequent lack of statistical power, the objective was not to accurately describe specific ecological interactions between livestock and fields, but rather to highlight directions to target for future work within the Biosphere Reserve
- furthermore, beyond the pure ecological meaning/purpose of this thesis, one key aspect of this work was to ignite the communication between farmers, scientists and managers of the BR.
- if this project did not strive for direct collaboration with the farmers, we hope it did build the first step towards a common understanding of the challenges and opportunities towards sustainable land use and food production within the BR.
