# Introduction & context: Feeding the world in a more sustainable way - How traditional food systems in Northern countries fit into the bigger picture

When facing the upcoming challenge regarding global food security [@kastnerGlobalChangesDiets2012; @vandijkMetaanalysisProjectedGlobal2021], with a food demand expected to increase between 30% and 62% by 2050 [@vandijkMetaanalysisProjectedGlobal2021], the temptation to dive into a "crop-mania" has already received some warnings [@foleySolutionsCultivatedPlanet2011, @hunterAgriculture2050Recalibrating2017]. Not only the core of the problem revolves more around optimizing food availability by reducing waste and changing diets rather than increasing food production [@cassidyRedefiningAgriculturalYields2013; @kastnerGlobalChangesDiets2012; @westLeveragePointsImproving2014], but conventional cropping systems have now reached spatial limitations. In Europe, land use changes during the past decades has already altered the agricultural landscape [@jongmanHomogenisationFragmentationEuropean2002], and keeping on the intensification track would sacrifice habitats of high conservation values [@bignalLowIntensityFarmingSystems1996; @haladaWhichHabitatsEuropean2011] without providing such a substantial increase in productivity or profitability for the farmer [@garibaldiFarmingApproachesGreater2017; @jeanneretIncreaseFoodProduction2021].

<!-- - 2050 food demand projection including climate change uncertainty: increase between 30% and 62% (@vandijkMetaanalysisProjectedGlobal2021) -->
- meat consumption is also projected to increase by 3% (per capita meat consumption) in Western countries even if the populations are already reaching a level which is harmful for their health (@alexandratosWorldAgriculture20302012)
- sustainable intensification has been presented as a solution to be able to fulfill the food production objectives (should look at: Godfray and Garnett, 2014; Cassman and Grassini, 2020) + short description of what sustainable intensification is (optimisation production, crop-based, biotech...) - also @rockstromSustainableIntensificationAgriculture2017 and @pywellWildlifefriendlyFarmingIncreases2015
<!-- - however, increasing the food production in some European countries to the FAO objective (+ 10%) would not even be possible even if all the semi-natural habitats were converted into croplands, as for example in Germany, Italy and Austria (@jeanneretIncreaseFoodProduction2021) -->
- there are also limits to the crop-based approach:
    - from 1961 to 2009 (~50 years), the percentage of calories from crop production consumed as food decreased from 57% to 51% (@westLeveragePointsImproving2014)
    - in Western countries, only 40% of crops are used for direct food production (@foleySolutionsCultivatedPlanet2011)
    - on the other hand, animal product has become the food category which accounts for the largest land use (38% in 2005 against 35% in 1963) compared to cereals (31% in 2005 against 40% in 1963). Half of the total cropland requirement increase is due to growing land demand for animal products (@kastnerGlobalChangesDiets2012)
    - there are unfortunately lots of waste in the process, as about 89% of the crop calories produced for animal feeds are lost, which makes that only 4% of the produced calories available to humans are in the form of animal products (@cassidyRedefiningAgriculturalYields2013)
    - a production-based strategy will also have a high environmental impact, including land degradation and biodiversity loss (@hunterAgriculture2050Recalibrating2017 + some others)
- It is therefore more a question of food availability than food production, especially in the Western countries: optimizing land use in the Northern hemisphere could reduce the impact in tropical zones on top of preserving local biodiversity  and cultural landscape, by switching from a grain-fed to pasture-fed animals (@foleySolutionsCultivatedPlanet2011)
- To counteract the current trend where land use is driven by market and technology instead of local environmental conditions and population needs, there is need for multifunctional use of the land and landscape planning (@jongmanHomogenisationFragmentationEuropean2002)
- This would need both regional and global collaboration, as 60% and 88% of biodiversity loss projection would be avoided under national and global optimisation scenarii respectively (@egliWinnersLosersNational2018)
- UNESCO MAB - Biosphere Reserve network as a great playground to experiment regional landscape planning & develop international collaboration ;-)
- maybe need to develop slightly on SDGs & 2030 Agenda
- Some examples here + blabla on us

# Small-scale grazing systems and cultural landscape

## Cultural landscapes and traditional agriculture

- Even in small-scale systems, changes in management with the use of fertilizers and seed mixtures, which can still affect species diversity (@beckmannConventionalLandUse2019). In our case, only 4 of our infields were without any sort of treatment apart from grazing.
- European cultural landscape is a complex & intertwined network of mosaics resulting from a multi-layered historical use (@vosTrendsEuropeanCultural1999)
- Categorisation of cultural landscape by the World Heritage Convention (see  @phillipsNatureCulturalLandscapes1998)
- With time, the primary role of agricultural areas, which represented the main labour supplier for food production, has declined at the same time as new demands have raised, such as recreation & nature conservation (@vosTrendsEuropeanCultural1999)
- "Traditional" grazing should not be characterized per se as low-intensity, especially in highly populated areas, though high biodiversity can still be hosted thanks to many nutrient & input gradients at local & regional scales (@plieningerTraditionalLanduseNature2006)
- Low-intensity farmlands are characterized by low nutrient inputs & low output per hectare (@bignalLowIntensityFarmingSystems1996)
- Traditional farming has shaped the landscape through involution (@vosTrendsEuropeanCultural1999), by adapting management practices to natural environment (@bignalLowIntensityFarmingSystems1996), in opposition to conventional agriculture which "replace" existing landscapes thanks to technological advances which give control over natural conditions
- [Land use history in Western Norway - (@bakkaEarlyFarmingHordaland1971; @hamreLandcoverStructuralChanges2007; @hjelleHesitantHuntersReview2006)]
- How grazing systems in Western Norway respond to traditional land use principles (@plieningerTraditionalLanduseNature2006):
    - Multiple use: farmers usually have a mixed system, with livestock, forest & crop (can rely on some examples from gårdskart)
    - Rotational use: inmark/utmark, also rotations between fields in the same area & between animals
    - Recycling: low nutrient inputs, again inmark/utmark process
    - Low-energy economy: small-scale farming, not much mechanical interference
    - Spatial fuzziness: interactions between different land use structures (e.g. grassland & forest) and processes
- [Here I should develop more about heathlands & the utmark system, with literature from Vigdis & Inger & Kari Hjelle]

## Biodiversity associated with low-intensity grazing systems & current trends

- All remaining high nature conservation value grazzlands across Europe associated with low-intensity livestock systems (Bignal and McCracken, 1996)
- [need some examples here, like threatened (or not) species associated with open landscape (e.g. birds, butterflies)]
- However the areas under permanent meadows and pastures have declined during the past 60 years. The trends is particularly sharp in Europe, which suffered from a 56% decrease, from 402 000 ha in 1961 to 177 000 ha in 2020 (FAO DATA, 2020)
- Principal threats are agriculture intensification and land abandonment (Bignal and McCracken, 1996), which lead to the homogenisation of the European agricultural landscape by the loss of regional biological and cultural diversity (Jongman, 2002)
- Semi-natural habitats such as Northern meadows or Fennoscandian pastures are fully dependent on agricultural management (Halada et al., 2011)
- Agricultural habitats have on average a poorer conservation status compared to other habitats (Halada et al., 2011)
- Past land use changes have already led to an estimated loss of 13.6% terrestrial "within-sample" (?) species richness, and worst-case scenario would lead to a reduction of 77% by 2100 (Newbold et al., 2015)

### The fjord system

The fjords in Western Norway are characterized by undulating topography which grows sharper in the inner fjord area [STILL NEED TO DEFINE THESE AREAS AT SOME POINT?]. The following features can affect plant and beetle assemblages by filtering the *natural* species pool at wider scale:

- the **elevation**: our study focused on grasslands in the "lowlands", thus the elevation gradient was limited with all of our sites located below 200 m. Yet, even at low level elevation can have an effect on local climate. including temperatures and precipitations [@zelnikPlantSpeciesDiversity2013].
- the **annual precipitations**:
- the **mean temperature of the warmer month**:
- the **distance to sea**: fjords are first and foremost defined by the sea arms which enter deeply into the land. These geological formations greatly affect the local climate by constraining wind currents and clouds [REF].

### The landscape matrix

Land use being greatly constrained by the fjord topography, the agricultural landscape is usually diverse with woodlands and semi-managed outfields mixing with the grazing fields. The different habitat types around the site will affect the species pools and flows [REF]:

- the **forest percent cover**: it is common for land owners in the fjord countryside to keep some forested areas for wood supply. The dominant assemblages should not be affected in case of limited forest surface cover, but a landscape mainly dominated by forest may affect the species pools of the fields.
- the **wetland percent cover**: the fjords in Western Norway are well-irrigated thanks to a high precipitation level [REF]. Same as for the forest cover, it is likely that the common plant species pool will not be affected, but hygrophilous beetles (e.g. Hydrophilidae, Ptilidae) could be found in surrounding areas.
- the **cultivated land percent cover**: small-scale farming involves a high variety of food production strategies to adapt to the productivity gradient, with a limited use of agricultural machinery [REF]. Cultivated land are usually represented by fodder crops and orchards, which could influence the dominant pool of forbs in the surrounding grazing fields.
- the **outfield percent cover**: traditional grazing management in Western Norway revolved around the combined use of low productive outfields (usually heathlands or shrublands) and high productive infields, with biomass taken from the former in summer (e.g. heath mowing or summer grazing), to enrich the latter [REF]. There can be a fine line between outfields and infields, especially closer to the coast. A high cover of outfield would induce an overall lower productivity of the area.
- the **infield percent cover**: infields correspond to more conventional grazing areas, such as meadows and pastures. In an infield-dominant landscape, we would expect the dominant plant and beetle pools to be relatively stable.

### The grazing management

To accommodate the constraining topography and the limited resources, grazing like farming practices are very diverse. Grazing is a well-studied habitat pressure which can trigger contrasting responses depending on its intensity and the local context [REF]:

- the **type of livestock**: traditional grazing management in Western Norway used to rely on sheep breeding, but the livestock has been diversified with cow and goat flocks. Each type of livestock has distinct grazing patterns and diet preferences which can affect the plant community [REF]. The type of excretions, which differs a lot between ruminants and other herbivores, is also likely to influence the dung-beetle assemblage.
- the **stocking density**: productivity being a major limiting factor in fjord areas, grazing systems in Western Norway can be qualified as extensive, even on the most productive infields. However, there will still be a gradient of intensity according to the type of grazer, the number of animals and the grazing area.
- the **farm infield surface**: rotational grazing is an important component of small-scale farming. The farmer divides the area into smaller fields where the livestock stays on shorter periods and rotates regularly during the year. Higher rotational capacity in extensive management system entails a lower grazing intensity.
- the **size of the field**: due to this rotational grazing system on a limiting topography, the size of each individual field can vary a lot between farms and within the same farm. A smaller field will be more sensitive to disturbances and to changes in species flows, and will be more subjected to edge effect [REF].

### The fine-scale environment

The last filters which apply to the plant and beetle assemblages would be the ones to define their immediate ecological niches, from both above- and below-ground [REF]:

- the **slope**: the fjord landscape alternates between hills and dips. The steepness of a slope affects the soil erosion potential as well as the water streaming: a sharp hill will suffer from regular soil renewal and nutrient depletion, while a flat area will store higher water and carbon  content [@klimekPlantSpeciesRichness2007a; @zelnikPlantSpeciesDiversity2013].
- the **aspect**: South- and East-facing slopes will receive more, and more intensive sunlight than West- and North-facing ones. The combined aspect and angle determine the heat load received by the slope [REF].
- the **soil compaction**: soil structure plays a major role in plant root development, and subsequent exchanges within the rhizosphere [REF], and arthropod movements and potential cover against disturbance [REF]. Soil compaction, assessed with the measure of bulk density, usually increases with grazing intensity [REF]. Thick grass root mats can also stiffen the soil [REF], thus an in-field penetration test can provide complementary information to the regular bulk density measurement.
- the **soil chemical composition**: nitrogen and phosphorus are the most studied plant limiting factors in agronomy [REF]. As high concentrations favor competitive fodder species, we can expect a correlation between nutrient load and dominant grass communities. Soil pH will affect the availability of nutrients by altering their chemical forms, and can therefore influence the plant species composition [@zelnikPlantSpeciesDiversity2013].
- the **structural diversity**: available ecological niches for beetles are highly dependent of the heterogeneity of the aboveground biomass. It can be explained by feeding preferences (e.g. phytophagous) or strategies (e.g. hunters by sight) [REF]. Taller vegetation is usually associated with higher cover and more diverse niche potential [REF]. On the other hand, presence of very short vegetation patches or exposed ground will be important niches for some groups [REF].
- the **soil moisture**: beetles are very sensitive to moisture gradients [REF] and some families such as Hydrophilidae and Ptilidae will be mainly hygrophilous [REF]. The bryophyte layer will help to maintain the ground humidity during the summer season [REF].
