# Acknowledgements

øøø jury for revisions leading to substantial improvement of the thesis

First and foremost, I would like to thank my two supervisors, Inger and Amy, who have bravely put up with me and my antics for this long.
You two were fully dedicated to your supervision task, being available any day of the week and almost any hour of the day, always accessible and ready to provide as much help as you could despite your heavy workload.
Being able to freely knock on the door of your office or send a quick one-line email for any small or big question was a privilege I am very grateful for.
I have felt extremely lucky since day one for having you two by my side, and this feeling has not changed one bit over the whole PhD period.

Now if I get into the specifics, I particularly thank you Inger for your pragmatism and your straightforwardness, as you were the one to raise the red flag whenever we went overboard with our ambitions.
I am also very grateful for your presence, kind and understanding, at the time when things got difficult.
Obviously the perspective of this thesis is largely influenced by your interest in the global food security challenge and food production systems, which you never missed to bring forward in our conversations.
Amy, you were my Swiss army knife, always coming with simple and clever solutions out of your pocket, whether be a sampling tool, a person (you have very big pockets) or R code lines.
Us two are veterans who pushed through both field seasons with determination and dedication, and for this achievement I think we deserve some praise.
You were also the one to open me the door to the wonderful world of R coding, which I know is a long and tedious journey ahead, but I also know for sure I will never go back from.
Hopefully soon I will be the one to teach you a few things in return.

This thesis is the result of team work. 
Along the whole PhD period, I was with my two partners, first Linn and then Silje, who took over such a massive amount of work that I could not describe it here exhaustively.
You were everywhere, all the time, doing everything: planning the field season; taking charge of all the logistics; contacting the farmers; co-leading the field team; organising the samples; sorting biomass; sieving soil; managing the TradMod website...
All the workload I could share, I shared it with you both, and you consistently assumed it with as much efficiency, precision and willingness I could ever have dreamt for.

I am also thankful to the TradMod team, Jarrod, Alicia, Ieva and Katja, who brought a very bright energy to the project.
The starting Lygra camp with the early TradMod team, including my one and only summer roommate and tatoo muse Micah, is one of the most precious memories I have.
My Morgane twin, and also my one and only master student. 
I know I will sound like a grandma, but you grew up so well within these years I have known you.
Your beautiful little family was definitely one of the highlights of my final year, and I wish you all the best for you three.

I was lucky to receive the support of many interns and students in the field and in the lab:
Ingrid and Kristi, my two hardworking BIO299 students with who I could share my nerdy passion for arthropods;
The 2020 team, Natalie, Christina and Anette, who brought fresh air and new energy to the field season;
the Måren family crew, invading the field with its workforce once in a while, and rewarding us with beautiful pictures.
last but not least Astrid, our very first intern in 2019, who has been by my side since then as a very dear friend.
It does not matter how far any of us go, once in a while we will always naturally find each other again as if we have never been apart.

I am also grateful to all the farmers and landowners who granted us access to their fields and shared their time and knowledge with us.
Special thanks to Tormod, for putting up with the biweekly visits of the TradMod team for all these years.

During my data analysis journey, I was lucky I could rely on Richard, Michael and Adam to compensate for my shortcomings.
All showed incredible patience and teaching skills for helping me navigate through statistical tests and analytical approaches, especially for paper III.
I am particularly grateful to Richard for sharing his R knowledge.
If Amy ignited the flame, Richard released the gas. Full pressure. 
The Open Science course was a real eye-opener on data management, reproducibility and accessibility, which was quick to upgrade my standards.

I would like to thank all my PhD colleagues, in Bergen and Steinkjer, with whom I shared offices, houses and conferences: Mayke, Maaike, Joseph, Christian, Ragnhild, Camilla, Arnaud, Siri, Nadine, Mie, Gabriel and Quentin.
Thank you for sharing your energy during these working hours, it was an essential element for the completion of my PhD.
Special thanks to Joseph, the LaTex Swiss Army knife (yet another one), who saved hours of my time during the very last week before submission.
- week-end workers

- Special thanks to Jonathan, the all-seeing and all-knowing housekeeper of the BIO department without whom the whole department would crumble.
- Always ready to help with efficient solutions despite being the busiest person in the building, seriously you are not paid well-enough.

I thank my one and only Bergen crew, my kendo crew, my GCBio crew, my Cucuff crew and my DnD crew, for pulling me out of my cave when I needed the most.
I also thank my family for supporting me over the years and putting their trust in my legendary stubbornness.

Finally, I want to acknowledge all these fantastic bands without whom I could not have gone through these everlasting lab, marking and writing hours: Hell, Satan, Attic, Blind Guardian, Iron Maiden, Inferi, Obsidious, Evil Invaders, Enforcer, King Diamond, Angel Witch, Accept, and of course our French gems Catalyst, Sortilege, Malediction and First Fragment.

# Abstract {#sec-abstract}

As we celebrate the 10^th^ year anniversary of the United Nations' report introducing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, scientific evidence keeps on demonstrating the unprecedented environmental footprint of agriculture worldwide.
In this context, research effort should focus on gathering knowledge and experience from farming systems which ensure the sustainable use of land resources and the ecological integrity of ecosystems. 
In the fjord region of Western Norway, a long history of low-intensity grazing and diversified farming practices has shaped an agricultural landscape of high ecological diversity and cultural value.
However, the post-WW2 rationalisation of livestock production led to concomitant processes of intensification on more fertile fields and abandonment of remote areas, resulting in a generalised decline of farming activity and area of grazed habitats.
In 2019, the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve was designated as a model area for the regional implementation of the 2030 Agenda Sustainable Development Goals.
This framework motivated research initiatives for the production of actionable knowledge for the sustainable management of land resources in Western Norway.

In line with these perspectives, this thesis aims to assess the influence of environmental and management factors on biodiversity and ecosystem service delivery in grazing-dependent habitats in Western Norway.
I led observational studies on 42 grazing fields distributed across the fjord region of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve to investigate: 
(1) the influence of the environmental gradient on habitat productivity and the composition of grassland communities at regional scale;
(2) the effect of field management, more specifically livestock type and prescribed burning, on the diversity and community composition of semi-natural grasslands and heathlands respectively;
and (3) the synergies and trade-offs between indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem services in the agroecological landscape of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.

I confirmed that the combination of topographic and climatic constraints of the fjord region generates a hump-shaped pattern of aboveground productivity from west to east by limiting forage availability on the outer coastal and mountain areas.
However, I found no evidence that the regional environmental gradients influenced the taxonomic or functional composition of semi-natural grasslands as an independent factor.
Regarding field management, I observed that livestock type affected the cover of plant functional groups, with higher grass cover in cattle-grazed fields, but showed no direct effect on vascular plant species richness or the composition of dominant grass, forb and beetle assemblages.
However, dominant plant assemblages were consistently correlated with the fine-scale environment of grazing fields, which itself was weakly correlated with field management.
This finding may indicate an indirect link between grazing management and plant communities in semi-natural grasslands, but whose direction remains to be determined.
In coastal heathlands, I found that xerophilous and sun-loving beetle species were more active on recently burnt patches, and I was able to determine new indicator species for both pioneer and mature heath phases.
I also added to the evidence that traditional prescribed burning contributed to the heterogeneity of heathland ecosystems at regional scale.
Finally, I observed a productivity-diversity trade-off between semi-natural grasslands and heathlands across the agroecological landscape of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.
Semi-natural heathlands were characterised by higher plant diversity, and semi-natural grasslands by greater forage availability.
I also showed that both habitat types supported the delivery of regulating services.
I found higher soil carbon content and cryptogam diversity in semi-natural heathlands, adding to the evidence that nutrient-poor habitats are essential contributors to climate regulation and water storage.
In semi-natural grasslands, I observed a synergy between trait-based indicators of nectar resource and forage resource, indicating that higher productivity does not erode pollinator food availability.

<!-- I confirmed that the climate-landform gradient of the fjord region generated a hump-shaped productivity pattern from west to east, constraining land use on the outer coast and in the mountains. -->
<!-- However, the regional environment only had limited influence within more fertile ranges compared with local topographic and edaphic conditions. -->
<!-- Grazing management promoted plant diversity, ecosystem service synergies and land use complementarity across the agroecological landscape.  -->
<!-- I observed a positive correlation between nectar resource and forage resource in semi-natural grasslands, while semi-natural heathlands showed higher species richness and soil carbon content.   -->
<!-- On coastal heathlands, rotational prescribed burning favoured xerophilous and sun-loving beetles at patch scale and contributed to ecosystem heterogeneity at regional scale.  -->
<!-- However, there was only limited evidence of the independent effects of management on grassland communities, as correlation analyses between grazing management and dominant grassland assemblages showed particularly inconsistent results.  -->
<!-- Livestock type affected the cover of plant functional groups, with higher grass cover in cattle-grazed fields, but did not influence vascular plant species richness or the provision of nectar and forage resources. -->

Overall, I demonstrated that semi-natural grasslands and heathlands in the Nordhorldand UNESCO Biosphere Reserve supported the delivery of complementary ecosystem services across the fjord landscape.
I emphasized that further research is needed for deepening our understanding of the complex interactions between the farmer, the livestock and the environment in small-scale grazing systems.
I recommend that methodological frameworks should be designed to capture the inherent variability of agroecological systems, by developing farm-scale assessments and transdisciplinary approaches.
Collaborative knowledge-building and inclusive policy-making in the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve are necessary to support sustainable food production and the conservation of agroecosystems in Western Norway.

<!-- From a methodological perspective, I discussed the limitation of our study design for capturing variability, which is inherent to the complex interactions between the farmer, the livestock and the environment in small-scale grazing systems. -->
<!-- I recommend the development of farm-level assessments based on flexible and transdisciplinary methodological frameworks to facilitate the implementation of research outcomes. -->

# Sammendrag

Når vi feirer 10-årsjubileet for FN-rapporten som introduserte Agenda 2030 for bærekraftig utvikling, viser vitenskapelige beviser stadig det enestående miljøavtrykket som landbruket har på verdensbasis.
I denne sammenheng bør forskningsinnsatsen fokusere på å samle kunnskap og erfaring fra landbrukssystemer som sikrer bærekraftig bruk av landressurser og økosystemers økologiske integritet. 
I fjordregionen på Vestlandet har en lang historie med lavintensiv beitebruk og diversifiserte jordbruksmetoder formet et jordbrukslandskap med stor økologisk mangfold og kulturell verdi.
Rasjonaliseringen av husdyrproduksjonen etter andre verdenskrig førte imidlertid til en intensivering av driften på mer fruktbare åkrer og en nedleggelse av fjerntliggende områder, noe som resulterte i en generell nedgang i jordbruksaktiviteten og arealet med beiteområder.
I 2019 ble Nordhordland UNESCO Biosfæreområde utpekt som modellområde for regional implementering av bærekraftsmålene i Agenda 2030.
Dette rammeverket motiverte til forskningsinitiativer for produksjon av handlingsrettet kunnskap for bærekraftig forvaltning av landressurser på Vestlandet.

I tråd med disse perspektivene har denne avhandlingen som mål å vurdere innflytelsen fra miljø- og forvaltningsfaktorer på biologisk mangfold og økosystemtjenester i beiteavhengige habitater på Vestlandet.
Jeg ledet observasjonsstudier i 42 beiteområder fordelt over fjordregionen i Nordhordland UNESCO Biosfæreområde for å undersøke: 
(1) innflytelsen fra miljøgradienten på habitatproduktivitet og sammensetningen av gressmarkssamfunn på regional skala;
(2) effekten av forvaltning, nærmere bestemt husdyrtype og kontrollert brenning, på mangfoldet og sammensetningen av henholdsvis seminaturlige beitemarker og lyngheier;
og (3) synergiene og avveiningene mellom indikatorer for biologisk mangfold og økosystemtjenester i det agroøkologiske landskapet i Nordhordland UNESCO Biosfæreområde.

Jeg bekreftet at kombinasjonen av topografiske og klimatiske begrensninger i fjordregionen skaper et pukkelformet mønster av produktivitet over bakken fra vest til øst ved å begrense tilgangen på fôr i de ytre kyst- og fjellområdene.
Jeg fant imidlertid ingen bevis for at det regionale miljøgradienter påvirket den taksonomiske eller funksjonelle sammensetningen av semi-naturlige beitemarker som en uavhengig faktor.
Når det gjelder forvaltning, observerte jeg at husdyrtypen påvirket dekningen av plantefunksjonelle grupper, med høyere gressdekke i felt som ble beitet av storfe, men viste ingen direkte effekt på artsrikdommen av karplanter eller sammensetningen av dominerende gress-, urte- og billesamfunn.
Imidlertid var dominerende plantesamfunn konsekvent korrelert med det finmaskede miljøet i beitene, som i seg selv var svakt korrelert med forvaltningen.
Dette funnet kan tyde på en indirekte sammenheng mellom beiteforvaltning og plantesamfunn i seminaturlige beitemarker, men retningen på denne sammenhengen gjenstår å fastslå.
I kystnære lyngheier fant jeg ut at xerofile og solelskende biller var mer aktive på nylig brente områder, og jeg kunne fastslå nye indikatorarter for både pioner- og modne heiefaser.
Jeg bidro også til bevisene for at tradisjonell kontrollert brenning bidro til heterogeniteten i heiøkosystemer på regionalt nivå.
Til slutt observerte jeg en avveining mellom produktivitet og mangfold mellom seminaturlige beitemarker og lyngheier i det agroøkologiske landskapet i Nordhordland UNESCOs Biosfæreområde.
Seminaturlige lyngheier var preget av større plantemangfold, og seminaturlige beitemarker av større tilgjengelighet av fôr.
Jeg viste også at begge habitattyper støttet levering av regulerende tjenester.
Jeg fant høyere karboninnhold i jorda og større kryptogam mangfold i semi-naturlige lyngheier, noe som styrker bevisene for at næringsfattige habitater er viktige bidragsytere til klimastabilisering og vannlagring.
I semi-naturlige beitemarker observerte jeg en synergi mellom egenskapsbaserte indikatorer for nektarressurser og fôrressurser, noe som indikerer at høyere produktivitet ikke reduserer tilgangen på mat for pollinatorer.

Samlet sett viste jeg at semi-naturlige beitemarker og lyngheier i Nordhordland UNESCO Biosfæreområde var støttet leveransen av komplementære økosystemtjenester på tvers av fjordlandskapet.
Jeg understreket at det er behov for videre forskning for å utvide vår forståelse av de komplekse interaksjonene mellom bonden, husdyrene og miljøet i småskala beitesystemer.
Jeg anbefaler at det utformes metodiske rammeverk for å fange opp den iboende variabiliteten i agroøkologiske systemer, ved å utvikle vurderinger på gårdsnivå ved hjelp av tverrfaglige tilnærminger.
Samarbeid om kunnskapsbygging og inkluderende politikkutforming i Nordhordland UNESCO Biosfæreområde er nødvendig for å støtte bærekraftig matproduksjon og bevaring av agroøkosystemer på Vestlandet.

# Introduction {#sec-introduction}

<!-- ## The role of Norwegian small-scale grazing systems in the current global food security challenge -->
## Livestock's part in the global food security challenge

<!-- Should we produce more to sustain more people on the planet?  -->
In the face of the global food security challenge [@kastnerGlobalChangesDiets2012; @moraExploringFutureLand2020; @vanmeijlModellingAlternativeFutures2020], with food demand expected to increase between 30% and 62% by 2050 [@vandijkMetaanalysisProjectedGlobal2021], the initial temptation to dive into a crop-mania has raised some warnings [@foleySolutionsCultivatedPlanet2011; @hunterAgriculture2050Recalibrating2017].
First, the prevalent issue is less a matter of gross production capacity than severe North-South inequalities in its redistribution and availability [@cassidyRedefiningAgriculturalYields2013; @fischerLandSparingLand2014; @tscharntkeGlobalFoodSecurity2012; @westLeveragePointsImproving2014].
Second, there is only very limited potential for the expansion of agricultural lands without conflicting with other land uses [@kimMappingEnvironmentalLand2018; @zabelGlobalAgriculturalLand2014], or critically damaging the integrity of natural and semi-natural ecosystems [@beckmannConventionalLandUse2019; @foleyGlobalConsequencesLand2005; @newboldGlobalEffectsLand2015; @newboldHasLandUse2016].
The livestock sector bears heavy responsibility for the latter, as globalised grain-feed systems have steadily replaced pasture-based husbandry following the Green Revolution [@kastnerGlobalChangesDiets2012; @ramankuttyTrendsGlobalAgricultural2018].
Contrary to initial claims, this transition provided relatively poor returns in calorie supply [@cassidyRedefiningAgriculturalYields2013] or economic profitability for the farmers [@garibaldiFarmingApproachesGreater2017; @jeanneretIncreaseFoodProduction2021].
However, it came at the cost of the decline and degradation of global grassland areas [@bardgettCombattingGlobalGrassland2021; @piipponenGlobalTrendsGrassland2022; @wirseniusHowMuchLand2010], as well as massive land appropriation and environmental externalities, particularly in the Global South [@cunninghamCloseYieldgapSaving2013; @hongGlobalRegionalDrivers2021; @naylorLosingLinksLivestock2005].

<!-- particularly in Europe [@auneLossSeminaturalGrassland2018; @schilsPermanentGrasslandsEurope2022]. -->

## From productivist agriculture to multifunctional agroecological systems

To shift away from a trajectory which places dramatic pressure on the Earth limits [@pelletierForecastingPotentialGlobal2010; @richardsonEarthSixNine2023], livestock production systems must be emancipated from the productivist doctrine [@altieriPerspectivesChallengesAgroecology2024; @ipbesThematicAssessmentReport2024].
For the past decades, a new dominant paradigm has acknowledged the synergy between food security, ecosystem integrity and human well-being [@ipbesThematicAssessmentReport2024], thus defending the potential for win-win alternatives [@fischerReframingFoodBiodiversity2017; @hanspachTradeoffsSynergiesFood2017; @wittmanSocialEcologicalPerspective2017].
These approaches have materialised through multiple concepts - e.g. agroecology [@holt-gimenezAgroecologyFoodSovereignty2012; @wezelAgroecologicalPrinciplesElements2020], diversified farming [@kremenDiversifiedFarmingSystems2012; @rosa-schleichEcologicaleconomicTradeoffsDiversified2019] or sustainable intensification [@prettySustainableIntensificationAgricultural2014; @rockstromSustainableIntensificationAgriculture2017], which share the consensus that food production should be diversified [@petersen-rockneyNarrowBrittleBroad2021; @rasmussenJointEnvironmentalSocial2024], and tailored to the local context [@cunninghamCloseYieldgapSaving2013; @prettySustainableIntensificationAgricultural2014], to support self-sufficient and resilient agricultural systems [@chappellFoodSecurityBiodiversity2011; @gardnerAgriculturalResiliencePerspectives2019].

In this new paradigm, grazing systems are not reduced only to their capacity for sustaining livestock production, but also conceived as a support of multiple benefits to human society [@kremenEcosystemServicesBiologically2012; @leprovostSupplyMultipleEcosystem2022].
The assessment of such benefits largely relies on the ecosystem service framework [@costanzaTwentyYearsEcosystem2017; @haines-youngCommonInternationalClassification2018], or also more recently defined as "nature's contribution to people" [@diazAssessingNatureContributions2018; @ellisEcosystemServicesNature2019], which has been generalised in policy-making since the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment [@millenniumecosystemassessmentmeaEcosystemsHumanWellbeing2005].
Ecosystem services are "ecological characteristics, functions or processes" [@costanzaTwentyYearsEcosystem2017] used as references for the economic valuation of all direct and indirect contributions of ecosystems to human well-being [@haines-youngCommonInternationalClassification2018].
They can be classified into provisioning, i.e. direct supply of energy or material resources (e.g. crops, forage, wood), regulating, i.e. biotic-abiotic processes which support the conditions for human development and prosperity (e.g. pollination, climate regulation), or cultural, i.e. non-material benefits to human mental and physical well-being (e.g. aesthetics, artistic inspiration) [@haines-youngCommonInternationalClassification2018].
The capacity of agricultural systems to ensure the delivery of multiple ecosystem services has been translated in policy-making through the concept of "multifunctionality", formally defined and promoted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) [@bjorkhaugMultifunctionalAgriculturePolicy2008; @oecdMultifunctionalityAnalyticalFramework2001].
According to the OECD, multifunctionality relies on "1) the existence of multiple commodity and non-commodity outputs that are jointly produced by agriculture; and 2) the fact that some of the non-commodity outputs exhibit the characteristics of externalities or public goods when markets for these goods do not exist or function poorly" [@oecdMultifunctionalityAnalyticalFramework2001].
The realisation of this multifunctionality pathway requires an extensive effort of policy-oriented research, to investigate synergies and trade-offs under different farming models and across multiple ecosystems and sociocultural backgrounds [@egliWinnersLosersNational2018; @rockstromSustainableIntensificationAgriculture2017; @runhaarFourCriticalConditions2021].

## Biodiversity and ecosystem service synergies and trade-offs

There is consensus that higher levels of biodiversity support a wider range of ecosystem services, because the underlying ecosystem processes are affected by different sets of species [@hectorBiodiversityEcosystemMultifunctionality2007; @soliveresBiodiversityMultipleTrophic2016].
A good example of such synergistic relationship is the pollination service:
plant taxonomic and functional richness supports a greater availability, stability and plurality of nectar resource, which favour in turn a more active, more abundant and more diverse community of pollinators [@balfourTradeoffPollinatorwildflowerDiversity2025; @goulnikFloralTraitFunctional2020; @heglandRelationshipsDensityDiversity2006].
In general, biodiversity was shown to be consistently positively correlated with the delivery of regulating and cultural services [@soliveresBiodiversityMultipleTrophic2016; @yangSoilCarbonSequestration2019], but its relationship with provisioning services is more complex [@leprovostSupplyMultipleEcosystem2022].
In semi-natural grasslands, diversity was shown to enhance biomass production and nutritional quality [@soliveresBiodiversityMultipleTrophic2016; @spehnEcosystemEffectsBiodiversity2005], but productivity-oriented management usually results into a loss of rare species [@brunProductivitybiodiversityRelationshipVaries2019; @schulzTradeoffsGrasslandPlant2024].
In shrub-dominated communities, stress-tolerance strategies are favoured to adapt to limiting environmental conditions such as low nutrient availability, water-saturated soil or short growing seasons.
Such strategies, including for instance belowground biomass allocation [@maGlobalDistributionEnvironmental2021], reduced leaf area [@scherrerDisentanglingProcessesDriving2019] or investments towards solidifying compounds (e.g. lignin) [@pierceLeafEconomicsSpectrum2007], limit the availability and quality of palatable biomass [@nelsonPlantFactorsAffecting1994].
On the other hand, shrub-dominated habitats are usually characterised by high cryptogam diversity, which contributes to multiple regulating services such as water retention capacity or soil stability [@eldridgeGlobalContributionSoil2023; @huStructuralCharacteristicsMoss2023].
Ensuring the multifunctionality of agroecological systems thus requires to rely on management strategies which support the diversity of organisms and habitats [@bengtssonGrasslandsMoreImportant2019; @gardnerAgriculturalResiliencePerspectives2019; @tscharntkeOrganicFarmingHarnessing2021].

<!-- - Negative impact of land use intensification on biodiversity and subsequently on ecosystem services/multifunctionality [@allanLandUseIntensification2015; @schilsPermanentGrasslandsEurope2022] -->
<!-- Most studies investigating the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem service delivery demonstrate the potential of a virtuous system under low-intensity farming, where higher levels of biodiversity support a wider range of ecosystem services [@leprovostSupplyMultipleEcosystem2022; @schilsPermanentGrasslandsEurope2022].  -->
<!-- Forage production is determined by both the availability and nutritional quality of palatable biomass, which primarily depend on environmental conditions [@nelsonPlantFactorsAffecting1994]. -->
<!-- Nutrient-poor and water-saturated conditions are limiting for forage production, but the reduced biological activity and the dominance of cryptogams contribute to multiple regulating services such as carbon sequestration [@liLongtermTemporalPatterns2023; @quinCallunaVulgarisdominatedUpland2015] or water regulation [@huStructuralCharacteristicsMoss2023]. -->
<!-- However, limiting environmental conditions, including for instance low nutrient availability, water-saturated soil or short growing seasons, favour stress-tolerance strategies such as belowground biomass allocation [@maGlobalDistributionEnvironmental2021], reduced leaf area [@scherrerDisentanglingProcessesDriving2019] or investments towards solidifying compounds (e.g. lignin) [@pierceLeafEconomicsSpectrum2007]. -->

## Productivity-dependent relationship between grazing and biodiversity

In wet regions, the effect of grazing on biodiversity is usually assumed to follow the intermediate disturbance hypothesis [@gaoCanIntermediateDisturbance2020; @milchunasGeneralizedModelEffects1988].
At moderate intensity, grazing pressure is expected to be strong enough to locally overcome the competition for light, but not so excessive as to homogenise the sward with grazing-tolerant species [@koernerChangeDominanceDetermines2018; @olffEffectsHerbivoresGrassland1998].
This intermediate stage of highest spatial heterogeneity should result in a biodiversity optimum, by favouring the coexistence of multiple life strategies and ecological niches for both plants and animals [@ceraboliniWhyAreMany2016; @steinEnvironmentalHeterogeneityUniversal2014].
Empirical evidence however shows that this relationship is not as straightforward, especially within the low-to-moderate intensity range [@herrero-jaureguiEffectsGrazingIntensity2018; @scohierHowSheepAffect2012; @wangGlobalMetaanalysesResponse2019], as it is for instance mitigated by habitat productivity [@lezamaVariationGrazinginducedVegetation2014; @pakemanLongTermImpacts2019].
In nutrient-poor habitats, the prevalence of stress-tolerance strategies usually limits plant growth rate and reproductive capacities [@diazGlobalSpectrumPlant2016; @pierceLeafEconomicsSpectrum2007], increasing the vulnerability of communities to ruderal and fast-growing species [@pakemanConsistencyPlantSpecies2004; @teuberLivestockGrazingIntermountain2013].
Still, grazing pressure is overall beneficial when temporally or spatially limited, using for example free-ranging livestock [@schneiderEffectsExtensiveGrazing2024] or rotational management [@perottiYearRotationalGrazing2018; @ravettoenriBiodiversityfriendlyRotationalGrazing2017].
Opening the sward facilitates the development of a diverse cryptogam layer [@aldayEffectsLongtermRemoval2021; @austrheimSynergiesTradeoffsEcosystem2016] and widens the range of ecological niches for arthropod communities by enhancing structural heterogeneity [@dennisResponseSpiderAraneae2015; @steinEnvironmentalHeterogeneityUniversal2014].
The relationship between grazing and biodiversity thus depends on both the ecosystem capacity to tolerate disturbance [@piipponenGlobalTrendsGrassland2022] and the management adaptability to abiotic constraints [@plieningerTraditionalLanduseNature2006; @torokGrazingEuropeanOpen2016].

## Diversified management in grasslands: the example of livestock type

<!-- The impact of livestock foraging on the structure and composition of the sward is determined by a combination of morphological (e.g. mouth parts), biological (e.g. dietary requirements) and social (e.g. group interactions) factors [@animutCograzingSheepGoats2008; @parsonsSpatialHeterogeneityGrazing2003; @rookMatchingTypeLivestock2004].  -->
Depending on local cultural heritage and/or national production incentives, grazing systems typically rely on different types of livestock [@rookMatchingTypeLivestock2004].
The direct impact of livestock on the diversity, composition and functionality of semi-natural grasslands is determined by a combination of morphological (e.g. size, mouth parts), biological (e.g. dietary requirements, digestive system) and social (e.g. group interactions) factors, which differ between grazer types [@animutCograzingSheepGoats2008; @parsonsSpatialHeterogeneityGrazing2003; @rookMatchingTypeLivestock2004].
For example, smaller animals such as sheep or goats are more efficient than cattle for reaching less accessible plants and selecting higher quality parts [@gaujourFactorsProcessesAffecting2012; @marrsReleaseSheepGrazing2020].
This foraging efficiency increases their relative consumption of forbs and proteins [@mohammedGrazingBehaviorDietary2020] and enables a more thorough and even utilisation of the field [@tothLivestockTypeMore2016].
In contrast, cattle focus on the most easily accessible forage and tend to avoid species with low leaf/stem ratio altogether [@grantControlledGrazingStudies1996; @rookMatchingTypeLivestock2004].
This more opportunistic behaviour increases the structural heterogeneity of the vegetation cover [e.g. @ravettoenriBiodiversityfriendlyRotationalGrazing2017], which in turns enhances plant and animal diversity [@steinEnvironmentalHeterogeneityUniversal2014; @tonnGrazingInducedPatchiness2019].
The size and weight of the animal also influence the trampling disturbance on soil and standing vegetation [@mayelHowDoesGrassland2021].
Compaction reduces the structural heterogeneity of the soil and the volume of pores, subsequently affecting soil biological activity and the nutrient cycling process [@erktanPhysicalStructureSoil2020; @nawazSoilCompactionImpact2013].
Trampling accentuates soil erosion on steep grounds [@hiltbrunnerCattleTramplingAlters2012] and deteriorates the cover and richness of the bryophyte layer, facilitating the colonisation of ruderal graminoids [@ludvikovaLongTermDefoliation2014].
Finally, cattle's digestive system make them produce feces in greater amounts and with different chemical composition compared with sheep or goats [@lumaretChangesResourcesConsequences1992].
This variation in the availability and quality of dung resource affects the abundance and functional composition of the dung-associated beetle community [@finnExperimentalInvestigationsColonisation2002; @lumaretChangesResourcesConsequences1992].

In agricultural systems, livestock's direct impact on the biotic and abiotic characteristics of semi-natural grasslands interacts with additional management practices, such as field enrichment [@socherInteractingEffectsFertilization2013].
Soil nutrient enhancement favours competitive strategies, leading to an increase of the proportion of nitrophilous grass at the expense of rare species, and more particularly bryophytes [@bochDirectIndirectEffects2018; @gaujourFactorsProcessesAffecting2012].
Inorganic fertilisation particularly was shown to have a detrimental effect on biodiversity [@degraaffEffectsAgriculturalIntensification2019; @kiddImpacts120Years2017], especially because of subsequent soil acidification [@caiIntensifiedSoilAcidification2015; @mengGlobalSoilAcidification2019].
The impact of livestock grazing on biodiversity and the delivery of ecosystem services in semi-natural grasslands thus results from complex interactions between grazer type, field management and environmental conditions.
It is necessary to disentangle these interactions for optimising farming practices according to the local context [@buzhdyganDirectIndirectEffects2020].

<!-- The strength and interaction of each process thus affect the functional structure of semi-natural grasslands, involving potential trade-offs between ecosystem services associated with grass, such as forage production, and the ones associated with forbs, such as pollination [@cutterCattleGrazingResults2022]. -->

## Diversified management in heathlands: the example of prescribed burning

In semi-natural heathlands, farmers have faced the challenge of sustaining forage production without further depleting the already limited nutrient pool [@rupprechtEffectsYearroundGrazing2016].
Over thousand years of history, fire has been found to be a valuable management tool to rejuvenate standing vegetation while redistributing nutrients in the system through ash [@kalandOriginManagementNorwegian1986; @walmsleyEnsuringLongtermProvision2021].
The severity of the prescribed burning is controlled to limit the disturbance on the soil upper layer [@hobbsStudiesFireScottish1984a] and enable the vegetation to regenerate quickly from both vegetative re-sprouting and the seedbank [@mallikEcologicalEffectsHeather1985; @marenPrescribedBurningRole2009].
The germination of *Calluna vulgaris* seeds was shown to be stimulated by smoke, indicating the long-term adaptation of northern heathlands to fire [@marenPrescribedBurningNorthern2010; @vandvikManagementdrivenEvolutionDomesticated2014].
The vegetation is the most palatable for the livestock during the pioneer phase of heath regeneration (0-5 years) [@thorvaldsenGammalnorskSauOg2017], which is dominated by grasses, sedges, forbs and fresh *Calluna* sprouts [@barclay-estrupDescriptionInterpretationCyclical1969].
To maintain fresh forage resource, prescribed burning is usually done in rotations, with new heath patches burnt every year.
This rotational dynamic creates a mosaic-like landscape of heath regeneration stages [@vandvikManagingHeterogeneityImportance2005], characterised by different environmental conditions and successional processes [@fonturbelEffectRepeatedPrescribed2021; @marenChangingContributionsStochastic2018].
The immediate effect of prescribed burning on diversity is usually negative, as fire disturbance generates a niche simplification effect by clearing out standing vegetation and homogenising micro-environmental conditions [@bulanEffectsTwoAcute1971; @murdochDiversityPatternPlants1972].
However, the heterogeneity resulting from rotational prescribed burning was shown to enhance the beta-diversity of plants, beetles and soil fauna [@bargmannEffectsPrescribedBurning2015; @milliganEffectsRotationalPrescribed2018; @rittlTraditionalNorwegianFarming2025].
At regional scale, prescribed burning was found to increase divergence between heathland communities when adapted to local environmental conditions [@velleDoesPrescribedBurning2014; @velleSuccessionPrescribedBurning2014].
Prescribed burning is therefore an important complementary practice to grazing management, as it enhances heathland diversity while preserving the local cultural heritage [@smithResolvingHeatedDebate2023].

<!-- - The regenerative cycle of *Calluna* heathland vegetation is comprised of three main phases [@barclay-estrupDescriptionInterpretationCyclical1969]: -->

## The Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve as a case study

### UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere Programme

Launched in 1971, the Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Programme, from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), aims to engage transdisciplinary and action-based research to "improve human livelihoods, and the equitable sharing of benefits, and to safeguard natural and managed ecosystems, promoting innovative approaches to economic development that are socially and culturally appropriate and environmentally sustainable" [@unescoNewRoadmapMan2017; @unescoManBiosphereProgramme2025].
This mission has been carried out since 1976 through the World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR), which, as of November 2025, encompasses 784 sites distributed across 142 countries and a total population of about 300 million people [@unescoManBiosphereProgramme2025].
Biosphere Reserves (BRs) are designated over a wide range of terrestrial and/or marine ecosystems as model areas for experimenting innovative pathways for sustainable development, with the successive strategies of the MAB Programme as references [@barracloughGlobalKnowledgeAction2023; @unescoNewRoadmapMan2017].
The latest Hangzhou Action Plan (2026-2035), the 2015-2025 MAB Strategy and the Lima Action Plan (2016-2025) further develop the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) from the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in order to facilitate their integration into national policy-making and international collaboration [@unescoLimaActionPlan2016; @unescoWorldCongressBiosphere2025; @unitednationsTransformingOurWorld2015].
Concretely, research in BRs has enabled the identification of identify synergies, conflicts and challenges over land use [e.g. @cusensParticipatoryMappingReveals2022; @konigUNESCOBiosphereReserves2022; @ruiz-mallenParticipatoryScenariosExplore2015; @tamouPastoralistsChangingEnvironment2018] and the monitoring of the efficiency of environmental measures and socioeconomic investments [e.g. @kratzerRuralInnovationsBiosphere2019].

In Western Norway, the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Area was designated to "be based on the best from the past and [...] pave the way for a future-oriented societal development that ensures the sustainable use of all types of resources for the benefit and pleasure of both the present inhabitants and future generations" [@kalandNordhordlandBiosphereReserve2018].
<!-- Agriculture in Western Norway carries a strong legacy of low-intensity grazing and diversified farming, which have shaped a mosaic-like landscape of remarkable ecological and functional diversity [@austadHumaninfluencedVegetationTypes1991; @olssonAgroecosystemsNeolithicTime1991]. -->
<!-- Even if the constraining environment of the fjord region has limited mechanisation [@fjellstadPatternsChangeTwo1999], the second half of the XX^th^ century was still marked by a steady process of rationalisation of the livestock production [@jonesLandtenureLandscapeChange1988]. -->
<!-- The change in farm structure led to a general reorganisation of the countryside, with on the one hand the enlargement and intensification of fertile fields, and on the other the abandonment of remote and nutrient-poor areas [@fjellstadPatternsChangeTwo1999; @hamreLandcoverStructuralChanges2007].  -->
<!-- These concurring processes were aggravated by an overall decrease of farming activity, caused by the socioeconomic decline and the ageing population of rural communities [@forbordDriversChangeNorwegian2014; @potthoffNorwegianLowintensityOvine2023].  -->

<!-- This change was reflected across the whole fjord region, with a loss and degradation of semi-natural habitats due to woody encroachment [@brynImpactsLandUse2012; @olssonLandscapeChangePatterns2000] and the coarsening of the landscape matrix [@hamrePlantSpeciesRichness2010; @norderhaugBiotopePatternsAbundance2000]. -->
In this context, the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve assumes a leading role for collecting practical knowledge and building partnerships in order to
(1) preserve the inherited ecological diversity associated with small-scale grazing and low-intensity management [@hamrePlantSpeciesRichness2010; @norderhaugBiotopePatternsAbundance2000] ([Box 1](#box-farming));
(2) ensure the resilience and functionality of the agroecological system in the face of upcoming global challenges such as climate change [@liuAssessingEffectsClimate2019; @meuwissenFrameworkAssessResilience2019]; and
(3) support decision-making towards multifunctional farming pathways integrating food security, conservation of the environment and the socioeconomic development of rural areas [@asheimPolicyMeasuresPreserve2020; @bjorkhaugMultifunctionalAgriculturePolicy2008].
The BR framework thus offers opportunities to assess the current ecological state of grazed habitats in Western Norway beyond the dominant conservationist perspective, by investigating the whole range of benefits provided by the farmers and their management [@bardgettCombattingGlobalGrassland2021; @goldsteinIntegratingEcosystemserviceTradeoffs2012].
More generally, investigating the small-scale grazing systems of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve will increase our understanding of the relationships between diversified and low-intensity management and the diversity and functionality of semi-natural grasslands and heathlands [@wehnAdaptiveBiodiversityManagement2018].

### Box 1. Farming system taxonomy {#box-farming}
Considering the diversity of farming systems around the world, a consistent naming framework is necessary to ensure accurate and reproducible comparisons between existing agricultural models [@huberFarmTypologiesUnderstanding2024].
Many terms have been used to describe an opposite to intensive and industrialised agronomic production models, such as, among others, "diversified", "extensive", "organic", "alternative", "agroecological", "regenerative", "sustainable" or "traditional" [@sumbergWhatConventionalAgriculture2022].
Even if these designations usually rely on explicit and practical principles [e.g. @wezelAgroecologicalPrinciplesElements2020], most of them still lack a consensual regulatory framework similar to the one developed for organic farming [@seufertWhatThisThing2017].
This fuzziness has been the cause of deeply rooted biases, of which the Western-centered "conventional" type of agriculture surely is the most representative [@sumbergWhatConventionalAgriculture2022].
According to its literal meaning, "conventional" only designates common practices in a certain geographical area and during a certain time period.
Therefore, there should be no inherent contradiction between "conventional" farming, and for example "traditional" farming, which is still predominant in many parts of the world [@altieriLinkingEcologistsTraditional2004].
However, in the dominant narrative, "conventional" agriculture has been strongly linked to the industrialised model of the Global North, while in opposition "traditional" farming has been rather associated with low-intensity practices, more or less rightfully [@plieningerTraditionalLanduseNature2006].
\
In this thesis, I used "traditional" only to describe formerly common farming practices in Western Norway, which have either severely declined, or disappeared over time, and which are today associated with the region's cultural heritage [@daugstadAgricultureUpholderCultural2006].
Regarding the current dominant livestock model, the most consistent feature of farms in Western Norway is their small production scale according to Global North standards [@klikockaCharacteristicsModelsFarms2021], both in terms of net income and flock size.
The net income for a holding in 2023 was on average 164,500 NOK (approx. 14,400€) [@ssbFarmersIncomeDebt2025], and the average number of heads per holding in 2024 was 25.3 for dairy cows, 11.8 for beef cattle, 49.7 for sheep and 110.6 for dairy goats [@ssbHoldingsAgriculturalArea2025].
In Norwegian, the terms "*småskala landbruk*" and "*småskala beitesystemer*" are used to designate small-scale farming systems and small-scale grazing systems respectively, which are terms also found in research literature for policy-making [e.g. @asheimPolicyMeasuresPreserve2020].
For consistency, I therefore used the expression "small-scale grazing systems" to characterise domestic grazing in the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve independently of farm structure, livestock type or management practice.
<!-- I acknowledge that this designation is still lacking in the sense that it can encompass many different models and thus may not reflect as accurately the evolution of agricultural practices in the NBR. I therefore encourage further discussion as part of the NBR management plan to determine specific terminology for the past, current and predicted stages of farming in Western Norway that will facilitate policy-making in the future [@gillerFutureFarmingWho2021; @huberFarmTypologiesUnderstanding2024]. -->

### The small-scale grazing systems of Western Norway

Agriculture in Western Norway carries a strong legacy of low-intensity grazing and diversified farming, which have shaped a mosaic-like landscape of remarkable ecological and functional diversity [@austadHumaninfluencedVegetationTypes1991; @olssonAgroecosystemsNeolithicTime1991] ([Box 2](#box-history)).
Even though the constraining environment of the fjord region has limited mechanisation [@fjellstadPatternsChangeTwo1999], the second half of the XX^th^ century was still marked by a steady process of rationalisation of the livestock production [@jonesLandtenureLandscapeChange1988].
The change in farm structure led to a general reorganisation of the countryside, with on the one hand the enlargement and intensification of fertile fields, and on the other the abandonment of remote and nutrient-poor areas [@fjellstadPatternsChangeTwo1999; @hamreLandcoverStructuralChanges2007].

::: {.callout-note #box-history}
### Box 2. The history of traditional farming in Nordhordland {#box-history}
The first signs of agricultural activity in Western Norway can be traced back to the early Neolithic period, with the introduction of burning [@hjelleLongtermChangesRegional2018; @prosch-danielsenPalaeoecologicalInvestigationsReconstruction2000] and domestic grazing [@hjelleHesitantHuntersReview2006; @mehlCulturalLandscapeDevelopment2015] which expanded the area of heathland along the coast.
By the time of the middle Neolithic, grazing management had reached the fjord and mountain areas, and by late Neolithic cereal cultivation had also spread in the more fertile, inner regions [@hjelleHesitantHuntersReview2006].
The initial hunter-fishers had progressively settled into fisher-farmers (*fiskarbonde*), who still depended on both sea and land resources to ensure their livelihood [@olssonAgroecosystemsNeolithicTime1991].
<!-- It is during the Iron Age that the traditional infield-outfield system of Western Norway, whose legacy has lasted till the present days, reached its maturity [@olssonAgroecosystemsNeolithicTime1991]. -->
To overcome the low productivity of the fjord region, fisher-farmers relied on a mixed crop-livestock system, involving both nutrient-poor outfields (*utmark*), which were grazed and/or mowed, and more fertile infields (*innmark*), which were cultivated [@austadHumaninfluencedVegetationTypes1991; @indrelidFarmingSystemIts1988] (@fig-succession).
The transfer of manure and mulch from the outfields to the infields created a flow of nutrients and energy which ensured the self-subsistence of farmer communities [@christiansenInfieldoutfieldSystemsCharacteristics1978].
This complementary management shaped the agroecological landscape into a mosaic of pluriactive family farms [@hetlandPluriactivityStrategyEmployment1986; @jonesLandtenureLandscapeChange1988], typically encompassing a few arable fields, several patches of semi-natural grasslands for rotational grazing and/or hay-making, and some forested areas for timber and fire wood [@austadHumaninfluencedVegetationTypes1991; @haugeGaldaneLaerdalWestern1988].
The heathland areas on the outer coast and in the mountains were used as outfields only.
Coastal outfields were grazed all year round, and farmers used rotational prescribed burning to stimulate the growth of young and more palatable *Calluna* stems [@marenEffectsManagementHeathland2009; @thorvaldsenGammalnorskSauOg2017].
Heather was also cut to provide winter forage for the animals [@lundbergAustevollChangingCoastal1991].
The mountain outfields were used for hay-cutting and summer transhumance of sheep, goat and cattle, to allow the recovery of hay-meadows in the lowlands [@indrelidFarmingSystemIts1988; @potthoffChangeMountainSummer2004].
As such, the traditional infield-outfield system in Western Norway utilised the whole west-east gradient of the fjord region, durably imprinting the landscape with a remarkable diversity of semi-natural habitats [@olssonAgroecosystemsNeolithicTime1991].

Despite the post-WW2 agricultural transition, the small-scale grazing systems of Western Norway retain a high diversity of land use and farm structures compared with the more productive Eastern plains [@dramstadTenancyNorwegianAgriculture2010; @forbordDriversChangeNorwegian2014].
Semi-natural heathlands, formerly outfields, are still grazed by free-ranging sheep or goats.
Livestock stays either all year round on the coastline [@lundbergAustevollChangingCoastal1991], or during the short summer season in the mountain ranges to allow pastures and hay-meadows to recover [@olssonLandscapeChangePatterns2000].
On coastal heathlands, some farmers have maintained the traditional practice of rotational prescribed burning (@fig-nbrgrazing A-B).
This management strategy requires specific skills and training, as the intangible cultural heritage from previous generations has mostly disappeared over time [@lundbergAustevollChangingCoastal1991].
On the more productive semi-natural grasslands, the agricultural transition has generated a socioeconomic gradient of farm structures [@blekesauneAgricultureImportanceViability1999].
It includes both full-time and more production-oriented farmers, often but not exclusively associated with mixed dairy-beef systems, and part-time farmers, who rather breed sheep or goats [@asheimPolicyMeasuresPreserve2020; @potthoffNorwegianLowintensityOvine2023] (@fig-nbrgrazing C-D).
At the scale of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, these different production systems are expected to complement each others in maintaining an ecologically diverse and multifunctional agroecological landscape [@kremenEcosystemServicesBiologically2012; @sollenbergerGrasslandManagementAffects2019].

<!-- If the economic viability of the former essentially depends on the meat and/or milk production, the latter benefits more from additional cultural values associated with "traditional" breeds, like the Norwegian old sheep (*Gammel Norsk Sau*), or practices, such as the small-scale goat cheese production in mountain summer farms [@daugstadAgricultureUpholderCultural2006]. -->

# Aim of the thesis {#sec-aim}

This PhD thesis aims to explore how grazing-dependent habitats support biodiversity and ecosystem service delivery in the agroecological landscape of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.
The research was designed in accordance with the objectives of the TradMod project, which were to provide actionable knowledge to support decision-making for sustainable land use in the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.
We therefore used an exploratory approach to
<!-- Our work was based on two main objectives: -->
<!-- (1) to estimate to what extent the environmental gradient of the fjord system determines the characteristics of the grazing fields and limits land use across different spatial ranges; -->
<!-- (2) to assess the effects of management, including livestock type, stocking density and prescribed burning, on the diversity, community composition and ecosystem services of semi-natural heathlands and grasslands. -->
(a) capture the diversity of environments and grazing fields typical to the small-scale grazing systems of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, by encompassing a large geographical area and a wide range of farm structures;
(b) take management-oriented perspectives, with an emphasis on the benefits provided by farming activity, by relying on the ecosystem service framework;
(c) provide a comprehensive data baseline including multiple taxa and ecological indicators, to steer future research in the agroecological landscape of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.

Our work was based on observational studies of 42 semi-natural grasslands and heathlands, distributed across the west-east gradient of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.
In **paper I**, we investigated the effect of rotational prescribed burning on beetle diversity and ecological preferences, by comparing active assemblages on patches of pioneer and mature heath in a sheep-grazed coastal heathland.
In **paper II**, we tested the influence of livestock type (sheep, cattle, goat) and landscape zone (coastal, fjord) on plant diversity and on trait-based indicators of forage and pollination services in semi-natural grasslands.
In **paper III**, we explored the cross-scale interactions between the regional environment, the landscape matrix, field management and the fine-scale environment of semi-natural grasslands, and their influences on dominant grass, forb and dung-associated beetle assemblages.
In **paper IV**, we assessed trade-offs and synergies between indicators of diversity, aboveground production, soil biological activity and soil carbon content, across different land uses (infield, outfield) and landscape zones (coastal, fjord, mountain).

These field studies were used to address the following research questions:

- **(Q1)** What is the influence of the regional environment on semi-natural grasslands and heathlands? More specifically:
  - **(Q1-1)** What are the productivity patterns along the coast-to-mountain gradient (**paper IV**)?
  - **(Q1-2)** Can we detect the influence of geographic or climatic factors on the taxonomic and functional composition of semi-natural grasslands (**paper II**, **paper III**, **paper IV**)?
- **(Q2)** How does management influence the diversity and community composition of semi-natural grasslands and heathlands? More specifically:
  - **(Q2-1)** Is there an effect of livestock type on the diversity and community composition in semi-natural grasslands (**paper II**, **paper III**)?
  - **(Q2-2)** What is the effect of prescribed burning on taxonomic and functional diversity in semi-natural heathlands (**paper I**, **paper IV**)?
- **(Q3)** What are the synergies and trade-offs between indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem services among semi-natural grasslands and heathlands (**paper II**, **paper III**, **paper IV**)?

# Research approach and study design {#sec-method}

## Study area

The Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve is an area of 6,698 km^2^ in Western Norway, delimited by the Bergen and Hardanger regions to the south, and the longest and deepest Norwegian fjord, the Sognefjord, to the north (@fig-maptopo A).
<!-- The biosphere reserve is delimited by the Bergen and Hardanger regions in the south, and the longest and deepest Norwegian fjord, the Sognefjord, in the north (@fig-maptopo A). -->
The western border stretches up to approximately 23 km into the North Sea, for a marine surface representing 37% of the total area, and the northeastern border reaches beyond the Stølsheimen mountains, which include the highest relief of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve at 1313 masl.
<!-- ### Geophysical and climatic characteristics of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve -->
<!-- In the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, the interconnection of fjords and fjord arms results into an intricate landform network (@fig-maptopo A). -->
<!-- This complex landform is associated with strong temperature and precipitation patterns (@fig-mapclimate), resulting from the simultaneous influences of two overlapping gradients of oceanity and elevation [@ketzlerClimateNorway2021].  -->
<!-- On the one hand, the warm and moist air masses brought by the Gulf stream maintain a generally mild and wet climate, which especially buffers temperature annual variations on the coast (@fig-mapclimate B).  -->
<!-- On the other hand, the elevation gradient is associated with a strong increase of annual precipitation, particularly on westerly exposed slopes (@fig-mapclimate A), and a drop of average July temperature (@fig-mapclimate C and D). -->
Fjords are defined as *"steep-sided, coastal erosional troughs which have been inundated by the sea"* after the retreat of the ice from the last glaciation [@howeFjordSystemsArchives2010; @mangerudIceflowPatternsPrecise2019].
The Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve encompasses 11 main fjords, associated with a multitude of fjord arms, which fragment the landscape and generate strong elevation gradients (@fig-maptopo A).
<!-- Due to the Gulf stream's influence, the climate is characterised by generally mild temperatures, especially on the coast, and high precipitation. -->
The climate is largely influenced by the warm and moist air masses carried by the Gulf stream, which buffer annual temperature variation on the coast .
Annual precipitation is high overall, ranging from 1560 mm to 4820 mm, and shows a sharp increase along with increasing elevation (@fig-mapclimate A).
Temperature shows the opposite trend, as both average July temperature and average January temperature decline from 15.9°C to 8.2°C and from 3.2°C to -4.7°C respectively from the lowest elevation to the highest (@fig-mapclimate C-D).

The combination of topographic and climatic factors has generated contrasting landscapes across the fjord region, which can be coarsely divided into three main zones (@fig-maptopo B).
The coastal zone is characterised by a highly fragmented "strandflat" landscape, typical to the Norwegian outer coastline.
Strandflats are partially submerged and gently undulating platforms which result from the last ice retreat [@norgesgeologiskeundersokelseNasjonalBerggrunnsdatabase2023].
On these exposed and rugged grounds, high rainfall intensity and frequency increase particle runoff [@zhangNutrientLossSensitive2020].
In the most extreme cases, erosion processes create nutrient-depleted landscapes of bedrock ridges, shrub-dominated vegetation and mires, typical of the outermost coastal strandflats [@chapinNatureNutrientLimitation1986; @winnerResponsePlantsMultiple1991] (@fig-landscape A).
The inner areas of the coastal zone and the fjord zone are characterised by an expansion of land area and sheltering reliefs, which creates more suitable conditions for agriculture.
These more central lowlands show the highest diversity of land use in the landscape, including forests, shrublands, grasslands and crops (@fig-landscape B).
Finally, the mountain zone encompasses large plateaus above the tree line and up to 1300 masl [@kalandNordhordlandBiosphereReserve2018].
A short growing season, high precipitation and low nutrient availability create landscapes relatively similar to the ones of the outermost coastal strandflats, with high bedrock cover, a large proportion of wetlands and dwarf-shrub dominated vegetation (@fig-landscape C).
<!-- The landscape composition of the fjord region from west to east thus reflects a coarsely hump-shaped pattern of primary production, determining the distribution of species and land uses at regional scale [@karlsenVariabilityStartGrowing2007; @siefertScaleDependenceVegetationenvironment2012]. -->

The Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve encompasses 8 municipalities (Alver, Austrheim, Gulen, Fedje, Masfjorden, Modalen, Osterøy and Vaksdal), with additional area from 4 other municipalities (Høyanger, Vik, Voss and Øygarden), totaling a population of approximately 55,000 inhabitants [@nordhordlandbiosfaereWebsiteNordhordlandUNESCO2025] (@fig-mapkommune).
Of the 1,650 farmers in the biosphere area who declared their activities in 2019 [@reiersenBaerekraftVestnorskLandbruk2019], around 530 were keeping cattle for an average of 25.8 heads per holding, among which about 320 had additional milking cows for an average of 21.1 heads per holding.
Around 1100 farmers were keeping sheep for an average of 41.4 heads per holding, and a little over than 200 of them were keeping both sheep and cattle.
Finally, only about 80 farmers were keeping goats for an average of 40 heads per holding. 
Farmers declared on average 6.8 ha of productive infields, ranging between 0.1 ha for the smallest field area and 92.3 ha for the biggest field area.

### Ecological survey in the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (paper II, paper III, paper IV)

The study area for **paper II**, **paper III** and **paper IV** aimed to be as representative as possible of the agroecological landscape of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.
Three main factors determined the distribution of the study sites:

  (1) the **west-east environmental gradient**, which we separated into three main regions, i.e. the coastal area, the fjord area and the mountain area, based on the landscape zonation from @uttakleivLandskapskartleggingNorgeLandscape2011.
  (2) the **field productivity**, classified as infields or outfields based on the land cover AR5 classification system of the Norwegian Institute for Bioeconomy (NIBIO) [@ahlstromAR5Klassifikasjonssystem2019]. Infields (*innmarksbeite*) were explicitly designated as "*agricultural lands that cannot be harvested mechanically* \[with\] *at least 50% of the area* \[...\] *covered with cultured grass or pasture-tolerant herbs*". Outfields were located on "open permanent lands" (*åpen fastmark*), briefly defined as "*areas that are neither a bog, agricultural, forest or infrastructure*".
  (3) the **livestock type**, including cattle, sheep and goats, as registered in @reiersenBaerekraftVestnorskLandbruk2019.

Additional criteria of site accessibility were also considered to facilitate field sampling, such as a maximum travel time of 1h from the University of Bergen (except for mountain sites).
Before visiting the fields, we contacted the farmers to have their approval for sampling, to verify management information, and to receive, when provided, advice on most suitable options for study sites.

Over the summers of 2019 and 2020, we visited a total of 42 grazing fields distributed in the coastal (n = 19), fjord (n = 17) and mountain (n = 6) areas of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (@fig-sitemap).
The field seasons ran from mid-June to mid-August, visiting coastal sites, fjord sites and mountain sites in chronological order to account for the timing difference of the spring bloom [@karlsenVariabilityStartGrowing2007].
Sites in the coastal and fjord areas were all located below 250 masl and showed relatively similar climate conditions, with average July temperature around 14°C and average annual precipitation around 1900 mm, except for the annual temperature range which increased linearly with distance-to-sea (@fig-climatedistri).
Mountain sites were located between 600 and 875 masl and were characterised by colder and especially wetter conditions (@fig-climatedistri), with an average July temperature of `r format(round(mean(filter(avgclim, EcoZone == "mountain")$avgtempJuly), 1), nsmall = 1)`°C, and half of the sites receiving more than 3500 mm precipitation annually.

```

Outfields were sheep-grazed, shrub-dominated communities (n = 12), located in the outer part of the coastal area (n = 5), in a former forest clearing in the fjord area (n = 1), and in the mountain area (n = 6).

Coastal outfields were Northern Atlantic wet heaths dominated by *Calluna vulgaris*.
The sites were grazed all year round by the Norwegian rustic breed, the Norwegian old sheep (*Gammel Norsk Sau*) [@norskinstituttforbiookonominibioSau2025], with an average of `r op(mean(coastal$FlockSize1_adults))` heads of adult sheep for areas ranging from `r op(min(coastal$SelectedFieldArea_ha), 0)` ha to `r op(max(coastal$SelectedFieldArea_ha), 0)` ha.
Three sites had been grazed uninterruptedly by sheep since at least 2000, one site had been grazed by cattle until 2016, and one site had been abandoned for 50 years until 2019.
Three sites were managed by rotational prescribed burning and one site had invasive Sitka spruce removed.

The single outfield of the fjord area was characterised by a transitional community, with high cover of *Galium saxatile*, *Vaccinium myrtillus*, *Agrostis capillaris* and *Anthoxanthum odoratum*.
The field of `r op(fjord$SelectedFieldArea_ha, 0)` ha was grazed `r op(fjord$YearlyGrazing1_month, 0)` months a year by `r op(fjord$FlockSize1_adults, 0)` adults from the Cheviot breed (*Sjeviotsau*), which had been on site since 1997.

Mountain outfields were subalpine dwarf heaths, with mixed grass-shrub vegetation dominated by *Nardus stricta*, *Vaccinium uliginosum*, *Empetrum nigrum* and *Calluna vulgaris*.
Sites were grazed by free-ranging sheep, with an average of `r op(mean(mountain$FlockSize1_adults))` heads of adult sheep staying on site between 3 and `r op(max(mountain$YearlyGrazing1_month), 0)` months in the summer season.
Common breeds were the conventional Norwegian white sheep (*Norsk Kvit Sau*), the Dala breed (*Dalasau*), which was one of the breeds upon which the Norwegian white sheep was founded, and the rustic English Suffolk breed (*Suffolksau*).
All sites had been grazed uninterruptedly by sheep since at least 2010, and as far back as the 1940s for the oldest record, and three sites used to be grazed by cattle.

Swards were dominated by either *Agrostis capillaris*-*Festuca rubra* or *Agrostis capillaris*-*Anthoxanthum odoratum* assemblages, with common occurrences of *Holcus lanatus* and *Poa pratensis*.
Average stocking density ranged from `r op(min(infield$AvgStockDensity_perha), 2)` to `r op(max(infield$AvgStockDensity_perha), 2)` livestock unit per hectare (LU/ha) (@fig-sitemanagement).

Sites grazed by cattle (n = 10) (**paper II**, **paper III**) ranged from `r op(min(cattle$SelectedFieldArea_ha), 0)` ha to `r op(max(cattle$SelectedFieldArea_ha), 0)` ha, for an average of `r op(mean(cattle$FlockSize1_adults))` heads staying on field between 2 and `r op(max(cattle$YearlyGrazing1_month), 0)` months.
The most common dairy cow breed was the Norwegian Red (*Norsk Rødt Fe*), but sites were also grazed by Limousin beef cattle, rustic Highland cattle or Aberdeen Angus beef cattle.
All fields had been grazed uninterruptedly by cattle since at least 2011, and as far back as the 1920s for the oldest record, except one which had a 2-year interruption between 2016 and 2018.
All sites were enriched yearly by artificial fertiliser, supplemented by manure for eight of them, and with an additional shellsand-lime mix for five of them to control soil acidity [@sognnesEffectsAddingMoraine2006].
Three farmers also reported to occasionally mulch their fields and only one farmer used herbicides. 
Three fields were resown between the 1940s and the 1970s, among which two were also plowed during the same time period, and three fields were drained between the 1970s and 2000s.

Sites grazed by sheep (n = 11) (**paper II**, **paper III**, **paper IV**)  ranged from `r op(min(sheep$SelectedFieldArea_ha))` ha to `r op(max(sheep$SelectedFieldArea_ha))` ha, for an average of `r op(mean(sheep$FlockSize1_adults))` adult heads staying on field from 3 to `r op(max(sheep$YearlyGrazing1_month), 0)` months.
The most common breed was the Norwegian old sheep, but fields were also grazed by the Norwegian white sheep, the Cheviot or the rustic Spælsau (*Gammel Norsk Spælsau*).
All sites had been grazed uninterruptedly since at least 2004, and as far back as the 1950s for the oldest record, except two sites which had a 3-years and a 5-years interruptions between 2012 and 2015 and between 2006 and 2011 respectively.
Six farmers treated their fields with artificial fertilisers and two of them also used manure, while only one farmer used shellsand-lime mix.
Five sites were mulched at least occasionally, and one farmer also burnt locally to facilitate the breeding of the Northern lapwing (*Vanellus vanellus*).
Three fields were resown before the 1970s and three fields were drained in the 1950s, in 2000 and in 2010 respectively.

Finally, sites grazed by goats (n = 9) (**paper II**, **paper III**) ranged from `r op(min(goat$SelectedFieldArea_ha))` ha to `r op(max(goat$SelectedFieldArea_ha))` ha, for an average of `r op(mean(goat$FlockSize1_adults))` adult heads staying on field from 2 to `r op(max(goat$YearlyGrazing1_month), 0)` months.
The most common breed was the Cashmere goat (*Kasjmir Geit*), but sites were also grazed by the Norwegian milking goat (*Norsk Melke Geit*).
All sites had been grazed uninterruptedly by goats since at least 2015, and as far back as 2000 for the oldest record, and five of them were previously grazed by sheep for various periods between 1969 and 2014.
Five farmers enriched their fields with artificial fertiliser, with one of them also using manure and another one using shellsand-lime mix, and one farmer treated the field with herbicide.
There was no mention of resowing or plowing in the sites history, and to the farmers' knowledge only one site was drained in the 1920s.

### Study of post-fire beetle assemblages in a coastal heathland (paper I)

The ecological survey for **paper I** was carried out at our most maritime coastal outfield, Hopøyna, in the Øygarden municipality (60°38′N, 4°49′E) (@fig-sitemap).
The climatic conditions are greatly influenced by the oceanic regime, with an average July temperature of 13.8°C, an average January temperature of 3.0°C, and annual precipitation around 1900 mm.
The site is located on a 115-hectare peninsula, which is typical of the most exposed coastal strandflats of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (@fig-oymap B).
The landscape shows two contrasting habitat types, with on the one hand highly eroded ridges, essentially dominated by *Calluna vulgaris* stands, and on the other water-saturated depressions characterised by *Molinia caerulea* mires.
The area used to be grazed by cattle until the 1970s, but was abandoned until 2018 when the current farmer initiated prescribed burning in the northeastern part of the peninsula (@fig-oymap A).
He burnt new patches progressing southwards in 2019, and the same year he brought in 36 heads of Norwegian old sheep for year-round grazing (~0.4 sheep/ha).

## Study approach and indicators

### Ecological survey in the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (paper II, paper III, paper IV)

We investigated the small-scale grazing systems of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve using an observatory approach to capture the actual management practices of the local farming community.
We relied on multiple taxonomic and functional indicators to obtain a comprehensive assessment of the impact of management on the diversity and community composition of semi-natural grasslands and heathlands (@tbl-papersummary).
The analyses of functional groups and traits, which directly express species' responses to abiotic stress and disturbance [@mouillotFunctionalApproachReveals2013], are particularly pertinent in our study context.
For example, plant functional groups are characterised by different life strategies, which determine their sensitivity to both the environmental gradients [@austrheimPlantDiversityPatterns2002; @klanderudImportanceBioticVs2015] and grazing management [@ludvikovaLongTermDefoliation2014; @tothLivestockTypeMore2016].
<!-- - Plants, and more particularly vascular plants, are the most commonly used taxa for biodiversity assessments in grazing systems [@kokEuropeanBiodiversityAssessments2020] -->
However, whilst plants, and more particularly vascular plants, are usually the main target groups in grazing studies [@kokEuropeanBiodiversityAssessments2020], they were found to be poor predictors of other taxa [@brunbjergVascularPlantSpecies2018].
Arthropod communities, for instance, have shown contrasted responses to management or changes in vegetation structure compared with plant communities [e.g. @hacalaComparativeResponsesSpiders2020; @lyonsImpactsContrastingConservation2017; @wangGlobalMetaanalysesResponse2019].
Similarly, soil organisms were found to be particularly sensitive to land use changes [@keithCrosstaxaCongruenceIndicators2012; @tsiafouliIntensiveAgricultureReduces2015], while providing both supporting and additional evidence to the responses of aboveground taxa [@birkhoferLandUseType2017; @leprovostContrastingResponsesBelowground2021].

Indicators were selected based on their roles in ecosystem functioning and subsequent contributions to ecosystem services in grazing contexts.
We investigated standing vegetation in all papers, particularly analysing the cover (**paper II**), taxonomic composition (**paper III**) and aboveground biomass (**paper IV**) of plant functional groups.
The structure of plant communities provides indication on synergies and trade-offs between ecosystem services associated with different functional groups, such as forage production for grasses, pollination for forbs or water retention for bryophytes (**paper II**, **paper IV**).
In **paper II**, we addressed more directly the delivery of provisioning and regulating services by using plant functional traits to design indicators of forage and nectar resource values.
In **paper III**, we investigated the composition of dung-associated beetle communities additionally to dominant grass and forb assemblages.
Coprophilous beetles ensure a key role in the nutrient cycling process of grazing systems, by transferring fresh dung matter belowground and stimulating decomposers' activity [@nicholsEcologicalFunctionsEcosystem2008].
Instead of focusing on typical "dung beetle" groups (e.g. Scarabaeidae), we took a coarser family-level approach to encompass the functional diversity of the whole dung-associated beetle community [@sigsgaardEnvironmentalDNAMetabarcoding2021].
Finally, in **paper IV**, we explored synergies and trade-offs among ecosystem services using indicators of both the aboveground and belowground systems.
We used the abundances of Collembola and Acari as predictors of soil biological activity [@birkhoferSoilFaunaFeeding2011], which supports the nutrient cycling process and the production of aboveground biomass [@bardgettBelowgroundBiodiversityEcosystem2014].

<!-- Bryophyte species richness particularly was shown to be strongly correlated with multidiversity [@manningGrasslandManagementIntensification2015]. -->
<!-- - change in plant species composition under rotational cattle grazing not detected when overall community considered but still significant for mesotrophic, oligotrophic & thermic groups in subalpine & alpine meadows [@perottiYearRotationalGrazing2018] -->

### Study of post-fire beetle assemblages in a coastal heathland (paper I)

We investigated the taxonomic and functional composition of beetle (Coleoptera) assemblages after prescribed burning using an observatory study of recently burnt patches and unburnt patches in the Hopøyna outfield site.
Beetles are particularly suitable for research on fire disturbance, as they are sensitive to changes in micro-environmental conditions, such as vegetation structure or soil humidity [@bargmannSpeciesTraitSelection2016; @schirmelResponseCarabidBeetles2011].
Beetles are also characterised by high specialisation levels across most families [@betzBiologyRoveBeetles2018; @kotzeFortyYearsCarabid2011], which have shown different responses to fire [@langeEffectsForestManagement2014; @prykeImportanceUsingMany2012].
Previous studies have also demonstrated the importance of functional traits, such as body size or diet, and ecological preferences, such as vegetation structure and soil humidity, in driving postfire recolonisation [@bargmannSpeciesTraitSelection2016; @driscollInteractionsBodySize2020].

## Data collection

### Ecological survey in the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (paper II, paper III, paper IV)

The data collection for **paper II**, **paper III** and **paper IV** was based on a common nested sampling design (@fig-sampling).
On each site, we defined a representative sampling area of 400 m^2^, which avoided at most exposed rocks, waterlogged ground, trees and field edges (@fig-pic20area).
The sampling area was by default 20 m x 20 m, except in two sites where it was set as 40 m x 10 m instead because of topography and field shape.
Inside of the sampling area, we delimited three plots of 3 m x 3 m, separated from each other by at least 6 m, following the same exclusion rules.
Each plot was divided into nine subplots of 1 m^2^, five allocated to non-destructive sampling and four allocated to destructive sampling (@fig-sampling).
The whole sampling process was designed to be completed within a day for each site.
On site, we collected GPS coordinates, maximum elevation and slope angle between the highest and the lowest point of the sampling area (**paper III**).
Slope aspect and climate data were obtained afterwards, from a digital elevation model of 10 m x 10 m cell size from the Norwegian Mapping Authority [@kartverketGeoNorgeKartkatalogen2023] and from 1 km^2^ daily projections for the period 2010-2020 from the Norwegian Centre for Climate Service [@meteorologiskinstituttNorskKlimaservicesenter2023; @wongGridded112016] respectively (**paper III**).

Non-destructive subplots (15 per site) (@fig-picplot B) were dedicated to the recording of sward composition and structure by the same two observers (Amy E. Eycott and myself) across both field seasons, including:
the identification of all vascular, bryophyte and lycophyte species and the estimation of their percent cover from 0.01 to 100% (**paper II**, **paper III**, **paper IV**);
the estimation of the percent cover of bare ground, rock and litter from 0,01 to 100% (**paper III**); 
the estimation of average sward height by random measurements (**paper III**).
Species that could not be identified in the field were collected for microscopic or expert identification.

Voldstad); (C) Aboveground biomass collection in Hopøyna (**paper IV**) (Øygarden municipality, © I. E. Måren).](illustrations/NBR_DesignPicSamplingPlot.png){width=100% #fig-picplot}

Destructive quadrats were dedicated to the collection of aboveground biomass, beetle assemblage and biotic and abiotic parameters of the soil system.
Aboveground biomass was collected within a 0.5 m x 0.5 m quadrat in each plot (3 per site) (@fig-picplot C), and sorted in the lab into cryptogam, monocotyledon, forb and woody vegetation for dry weight measurements (**paper IV**).
We performed two tests of soil resistance to penetration in each subplot (24 per site), by dropping a sharpened metal rod of 1.3 kg (length 43.4 cm; diameter 2.2 cm) from 1 m above the ground through a PVC tube to ensure vertical fall (@fig-picquadrat A) (**paper III**).
Soil was also collected with two types of cores in each 1 m^2^ subplot.
First, three smaller PVC cores of 57.23 cm^3^ (3.7 cm diameter; 10 cm height) (@fig-picquadrat B) were used for the estimation of bulk density and gravimetric water content (36 per site) (**paper III**).
Second, a bigger stainless steel cylindrical core of 200 cm^3^ (diameter 10.5 cm; height 12 cm) (@fig-picquadrat C) was used for mesofauna collection (**paper IV**), from one core out of four per plot (3 per site), and chemical analyses (**paper III**, **paper IV**), from the three remaining cores.
Mesofauna was extracted with Berlese-Tullgren funnels [@tullgrenSehrEinfacherAusleseapparat1918], stored into 70% ethanol and sorted into Collembola and Acari.
The soil for chemical analyses was sieved and merged at the plot level (3 per site).
A subsample of 0.5 L was sent to a certified analysis laboratory for the determination of loss of ignition (LOI) [@schulteEstimationSoilOrganic1996], total nitrogen content with modified Kjeldahl method (NS-EN13654-1:2890) [@bremnerDeterminationNitrogenSoil1960] and available phosphorus concentration with ammonium lactate extraction method [@brayDeterminationTotalOrganic1945].
We finally set dung-baited pitfall traps (diameter 10.5 cm; height 11.5 cm) in the holes left by the stainless steel core (12 per site) to collect ground-dwelling beetles for a full week (@fig-picquadrat D) (**paper III**).
Specimens were sorted at the family level using @duffBeetlesBritainIreland2012a and stored in 70% ethanol.

### Study of post-fire beetle assemblages in a coastal heathland (paper I)

In summer 2020, we collected ground-dwelling beetles on five replicates of pioneer heath in the recently burnt area of the Hopøyna site and on five replicates of mature heath in the southern area (@fig-oymap B).
The collection period was divided into two sampling rounds of 15 days each between mid-June and early August.
The sampling design was elaborated to fit the narrow shape of the burnt patches, which were mostly restricted to bedrock ridges.
On each replicate, we placed four octagonal sets of pitfall traps every 10 m along a 40 m transect which followed the direction of the slope (32 pitfall traps per replicate).
Traps were plastic cups of 6.5 cm diameter (250 mL) set 1 m apart from each other, and covered with a metal roof in the burnt area to prevent overflowing (@fig-oymap C).
Beetles were collected every week and stored in 70% ethanol after sorting at the species level.
We used the Fauna Entomologica Scandinavica series [@lindrothCarabidaeColeopteraFennoscandia1985; @lindrothCarabidaeColeopteraFennoscandia1986] for the identification of Carabidae, the Swedish Insect fauna (*Svensk Insektfauna*) series [@palmSkalbaggarColeopteraKortvingar1961; @palmSkalbaggarColeopteraKortvingar1963; @palmSkalbaggarColeopteraKortvingar1966; @palmSkalbaggarColeopteraKortvingar1968; @palmSkalbaggarColeopteraKortvingar1972] for Staphylinidae, and the Beetles of Britain and Ireland series [@duffBeetlesBritainIreland2012a; @duffBeetlesBritainIreland2012; @duffBeetlesBritainIreland2020] for all other families.
Staphylinidae were identified by John Skartveit, who also verified the identification of all other species and provided very valuable expert knowledge (see Acknowledgements in **paper I**).
Morphological traits (body size, wing presence) and ecological preferences in relation to moisture and ground cover were collected from the same taxonomic references.

### Farmer interviews

Between October 2021 and January 2022, we conducted phone interviews with the 39 farmers who managed the visited sites to collect detailed information on the livestock and the field management.
We specifically asked for:
the livestock breed;
the number of adult and young animals (**paper III**);
the surface area of the field we visited (**paper III**);
the occupation period of the field by livestock (**paper III**);
the grazing history including current and former livestock as well as past land use;
the type, frequency and intensity of additional management, e.g. fertilisation, mulching and burning.
For the 6 farmers who were unable or unwilling to reply to the questionnaire, we referred to the data collected by @reiersenBaerekraftVestnorskLandbruk2019, which was not site-specific but still provided general information on the related farms (e.g. livestock types, flock size).
We also relied on the open data from the agricultural properties mapping service (*Gårdskart*) of the Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy [@norskinstituttforbiookonominibioGardskart2023] to retrieve, when available, the field surface area (**paper III**).
Due to incomplete and/or approximate information regarding additional management (e.g. fertiliser amount or frequency), these data were, for most part, unfortunately not included in the analyses.
However, they proved very valuable for providing concrete context to the sites we visited and also allowed us to verify the circumstances of odd values when necessary (e.g. Acari abundance in infields in **paper IV**).

\newpage

## Analytical methods

Considering the limited site replication (42 sites in total), we favoured robustness over sensitivity when selecting statistical tests and analyses.
All analyses were performed in R versions 4.1.1 (**paper II**), 4.1.3 (**paper I**) and 4.4.1 (**paper III**, **paper IV**) [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2024] with R studio versions 1.4.1717 (**paper I**) and 2023.04.2 (**paper III**, **paper IV**) [@positteamRStudioIntegratedDevelopment2024].
Unless otherwise indicated, we usually relied on the *vegan* package [@oksanenVeganCommunityEcology2024] versions 2.6-2 (**paper I**), 2.6-4 (**paper II**) and 2.6-8 (**paper III**) for ordination analyses and used the *ggplot2* package [@wickhamGgplot2CreateElegant2024] versions 3.3.5 (**paper I**), 3.4.0 (**paper II**) and 3.5.1 (**paper III**, **paper IV**) for visual representation.

### Study of post-fire beetle assemblages in a coastal heathland (paper I)

<!-- Since @barclay-estrupDescriptionInterpretationCyclical1969, the post-fire recovery of plant communities in Northern coastal heathlands has been extensively studied, especially in Western Norway [e.g. @marenPrescribedBurningNorthern2010; @marenChangingContributionsStochastic2018; @vandvikManagingHeterogeneityImportance2005; @vandvikManagementdrivenEvolutionDomesticated2014; @velleDoesPrescribedBurning2014]. -->
In Western Norway, research on the impact of prescribed burning on arthropod communities was initiated by @bargmannEffectsPrescribedBurning2015 and @bargmannSpeciesTraitSelection2016, who focused on ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae).
In **paper I**, we aimed to further expand our knowledge of the recolonisation of ground-dwelling taxa after fire, by investigating the activity of the whole beetle (Coleoptera) community.
<!-- In **paper I**, we aimed to contribute to the already extensive literature on prescribed burning in Western Norway, which has mostly focused on the responses of plant communities [e.g. @marenPrescribedBurningNorthern2010; @marenChangingContributionsStochastic2018; @vandvikManagingHeterogeneityImportance2005; @vandvikManagementdrivenEvolutionDomesticated2014; @velleDoesPrescribedBurning2014], and also ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) to a lesser extent [@bargmannEffectsPrescribedBurning2015; @bargmannSpeciesTraitSelection2016], but other beetle families have yet to be investigated. -->
We compared the diversity, composition and ecological preferences between beetle assemblages collected on pioneer heath patches, one to two years after fire, and on mature heath patches, undisturbed for several decades.
Statistical analyses were based on beetle species count data, pooled at the replicate level (n = 10).
We tested the differences in species richness, Shannon diversity (H) and Simpson's evenness (E~1/D~) [@smithConsumerGuideEvenness1996] with non-parametric Wilcoxon tests.
Beta-diversity was estimated as the group dispersion between patches of the same heath stage based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity [@schroederHowRobustAre2018], and was compared between heath stages with an ANOVA.
We analysed the community composition according to the date of fire (undisturbed; 2-years post-burn; 1-year post-burn) using Constrained Correspondance Analysis (CCA) with ANOVA permutation test.
We also identified indicator species for pioneer and mature heath patches relying on both the phi's coefficient of correlation [@sokalBiometryPrinciplesPractice2012] and the IndVal index [@dufreneSpeciesAssemblagesIndicator1997], calculated with the *indicspecies* package from @decaceresIndicspeciesRelationshipSpecies2022.
Finally, we compared the distributions of the community weighted means of body size, the wing morphology and the moisture and vegetation cover preferences between assemblages from pioneer and mature heath patches using Fisher t-tests.

### Ecosystem services in semi-natural grasslands grazed by different livestock types (paper II)

In Western Norway, the delivery of ecosystem services in semi-natural grasslands has mostly been studied in relation to land abandonment [e.g. @johansenCeasedGrazingManagement2019; @wehnRelationshipsBiodiversityEcosystem2018].
In **paper II**, we aimed to investigate more specifically the effects of grazing management and the environmental variation on forage production and pollination services.
We compared plant diversity, functional group composition, and nectar and forage resource values of 30 permanent grasslands according to landscape zone (coastal, fjord) and livestock type (cattle, sheep, goats).
We expected trade-offs according to the productivity gradient between the coastal and the fjord areas and to the feeding preferences of the grazers.
Statistical analyses were based on plant species cover-abundance data, pooled at the plot level (n = 60).
The nectar resource indicator was based on the annual nectar productivity per unit cover from @baudeHistoricalNectarAssessment2016 and ranked from 0 to 4 using @melinBotaniqueApicoleApicultural2011.
The forage resource indicator was collected from the e-flora-sys database [@plantureuxEFLORAsysWebsiteTool2010] and scaled from 0 to 3 according to functional type.
We used linear mixed-effects models with the *lme4* package [@batesFittingLinearMixedEffects2015] to test the independent and interacting effects of landscape zone and livestock type on vascular plant species richness, nectar and forage values and on the scores of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of plant functional groups, with the year of sampling and the observer as confounding factors.
We analysed synergies and trade-offs by testing correlations between vascular plant species richness, nectar indicator value and forage indicator value with either Kendall non-parametric correlation (richness x nectar), Pearson linear correlation (richness x forage) or Spearman rank non-parametric correlation (nectar x forage).
We finally relied on Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Problems [@yoonMultipleAttributeDecision1995] using the *topsis* package from @yazdiTopsisTOPSISMethod2013 to rank our sites according to their level of within-field synergy between plant species richness, forage resource indicator and nectar resource indicator.

### Cross-scale interactions in the small-scale grazing system of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (paper III)

**Paper III** was, to our knowledge, the first attempt at disentangling the environmental and management-dependent processes affecting the composition of semi-natural grasslands in the fjord region of Western Norway.
Our analysis was based on a simplified conceptual model of the agroecological system of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve including four spatial scales (regional, landscape, field, fine).
We tested
(1) correlations between sets of variables characterising the environmental gradients (regional, landscape, fine) and the grazing management (field),
and (2) correlations between these explanatory sets and the composition of dominant grass, forb and dung-associated beetle assemblages.
The regional-scale set represented the environmental variation driven by the climate and the landform of the fjord region;
the landscape-scale set represented the composition of the landscape matrix;
the field-scale set included stocking density, livestock type and field area;
finally, the fine-scale set encompassed indicators of sward structure, topography and edaphic conditions.
Explanatory sets were based on quantitative variables (except livestock type), pooled at the site level when necessary (n = 29), and verified for odd distributions and strong colinearity.
Response assemblages were based on plant species cover-abundance data and beetle count data, all pooled at the site level (n = 29) and scaled with Hellinger transformation [@borcardNumericalEcology2011].
We performed preliminary canonical correlation analyses between all sets using the *CCA* package [@gonzalezCCACanonicalCorrelation2023] and the asymptotic approximation of Hotelling-Lawley trace from the *CCP* package [@menzelCCPSignificanceTests2022].
Significant canonical correlations were further analysed with Redundancy Analyses (RDA) [@legendreNumericalEcology2012], tested with ANOVA permutation [@legendreTestingSignificanceCanonical2011], to identify the variables with the strongest explanatory power among sets.

### Ecosystem service trade-offs and synergies across the west-east gradient of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (paper IV)

In Western Norway, the delivery of ecosystem services associated with grazing has so far been assessed for single habitat types, i. e. semi-natural grasslands and heathlands respectively [e.g. @austrheimSynergiesTradeoffsEcosystem2016; @johansenCeasedGrazingManagement2019].
In **paper IV**, we aimed to explore trade-offs and synergies across the whole agroecological landscape, ranging from coastal heathlands, to lowland grasslands and subalpine heathlands.
We compared the contribution of 23 sheep-grazed fields to indicators of diversity, aboveground production, soil activity and soil carbon content, and investigated synergies and trade-offs associated with field type (infield, outfield) and geographical area (coastal, fjord, mountain).
Statistical analyses were based on plant species cover-abundance, aboveground biomass dry weight, Collembola and Acari count data, and soil loss on ignition, scaled and pooled at the site level (n = 23).
We used Ward's hierarchical agglomerative clustering based on Euclidean distance matrix and the adjusted Wallace index to compare the observed and expected site aggregation, according to field type for the first branching level and to geographical area for the second branching levels [@warrensUnderstandingAdjustedRand2022].
We tested correlations between ecosystem service indicators with Spearman's rank tests [@hollanderNonparametricStatisticalMethods2015], and compared their distribution between primary and secondary clusters with unpaired Mann-Whitney tests [@lehmannNonparametricsStatisticalMethods2006].
Additional effect size was calculated from the Glass rank biserial correlation coefficient [@kingStatisticalReasoningBehavioral2018].

# Main findings and discussion {#sec-findings}

## (Q1) What is the influence of the regional environment on semi-natural grasslands and heathlands (paper II, paper III, paper IV)?

### (Q1-1) What are the productivity patterns along the coast-to-mountain gradient (paper IV)?

In **paper IV**, field type (infield, outfield) was the primary factor of hierarchical aggregation of grazing fields, independently of geographical area.
As expected, this difference was explained by the negative correlation between forb biomass, higher in infields, and shrub biomass, higher in outfields.
We can see that forb biomass indeed follows a hump-shaped pattern when plotted against longitude (@fig-fjordR1 B), while shrub biomass follows the opposite trend (@fig-fjordR1 A).
Our results show how the combination of topographic and climatic constraints in the fjord region limits plant growth in outer areas, while inner lowland areas are more suitable for agricultural production.
This west-east productivity pattern was found to be a major determinant for the historical development of land use in Western Norway [@mehlCulturalLandscapeDevelopment2015].
In addition, we observed that mountain sites showed on average four times less shrub biomass and three times less cryptogam biomass than on the coast (**paper IV**).
Plant productivity in mountainous regions is inhibited by the lower temperatures and subsequent shorter growing seasons [@michaletzDriversTerrestrialPlant2018].
Our results may suggest lower productivity and thus lower regenerative capacity in the subalpine area compared with the coastal area, but we cannot confirm this without taking a more experimental approach.
Still, farm management practices may provide an indication, as only on the coast have farmers developed a tradition of managed burning to suppress aging in heather stands [@barclay-estrupDescriptionInterpretationCyclical1969; @thorvaldsenGammalnorskSauOg2017] (see Discussion in **paper IV**).

We found no evidence that soil biological activity followed a similar hump-shaped pattern along the west-east gradient, as neither Acari nor Collembola abundances showed consistent trends with field type or geographical area (**paper IV**; @fig-fjordR1 C-D).
This outcome questions the suitability of soil mesofauna abundance as an indicator of soil fertility in agroecological systems (see Discussion in **paper IV**).
In @georgeEvaluationMesofaunaCommunities2017, total mesofauna abundance showed a hump-shaped pattern along a productivity gradient ranging from crops to forests, but there was no difference between grasslands and heathlands.
Only their more detailed analysis of trophic groups showed that fungivorous mites (Oribatida) were more abundant in heathlands and bogs compared with fertile grasslands [see also @arnottUplandGrasslandHabitats2021].
In our study context, a finer taxonomic resolution may thus have been necessary to interpret patterns of soil mesofauna across field types and geographical areas (see Discussion in **paper IV**).

### (Q1-2) Can we detect the influence of geographic or climatic factors on the taxonomic and functional composition of semi-natural grasslands (paper II, paper III, paper IV)?

Our results showed no evidence of an independent effect of the regional environment on our grassland sites.
Landscape zone (coastal, fjord) was neither a factor of aggregation of infields in **paper IV**, nor a significant predictor of plant functional group cover in **paper II**, contrary to what could be suggested by a visual observation of the community structure (e.g. @fig-fjordR2 A and B).
In **paper III**, canonical correlations between the regional environment and dominant grass and dung-associated beetle assemblages were significant, but none were supported by their respective RDA models (**ref fig**).
Within the central and more productive lowland area of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, we can assume that the gradient of abiotic pressure (oceanity, elevation) may be too limited to drive changes in the communities (see Discussion in **paper II**).
Furthermore, for the spatial extent of our study area (approximately 900 km^2^), the influence of regional processes is more likely to be overridden by local climatic and topographic variables [@siefertScaleDependenceVegetationenvironment2012] (see Discussion in **paper III**).
In comparison, ecological studies whose primary aim was to describe geographical effects on grassland species composition usually include stronger environmental gradients [e.g. @zelnikPlantSpeciesDiversity2013] and/or rely on broader areas [e.g. @raatikainenImpactsLocalRegional2007].

The inconsistent outcomes from **paper III** may also suggest that relationships between the underlying regional gradient and plant and beetle communities are characterised by more complex interactions [@dixonhamilCrossscaleContradictionsEcological2016; @petersCrossScaleInteractions2007] (see Discussion in **paper III**).
In **paper II** for example, we observed significant changes in plant functional group cover due to interactions between landscape zone and livestock type:
coastal sites grazed by cattle were characterised by the lowest forb cover, while fjord sites grazed by cattle showed the lowest grass/forb cover ratio.
In an extensive study on meadow communities in Western Norway, @losvikHayMeadowCommunities1993 observed a divergence between coastal and boreal meadows associated with a fertilisation gradient, suggesting that grasslands further inland were, at the time, more productive and more intensively managed (see Discussion in **paper IV**).
In our study area, we found no evidence of such interactions between the regional environment and field management (**paper III**), but we nevertheless recommend to lead further research with a more robust methodological framework [e.g. @redlichDisentanglingEffectsClimate2022] (see Discussion in **paper III**).
It would be particularly relevant to replicate the survey from @losvikHayMeadowCommunities1993, in order to investigate the changes in plant communities and in their relationships with environmental and management factors over time (see Discussion in **paper IV**).

## (Q2) How does management influence the diversity and composition of semi-natural grasslands and heathlands (paper I, paper II, paper III, paper IV)?

### (Q2-1) Is there an effect of livestock type on the diversity and composition in semi-natural grasslands (paper II, paper III)?

<!-- **QUESTION to Inger and Amy**: "In our ecological study, livestock type is representative of both the direct animal impact and the agronomic production system, involving for instance stocking density." - I already described this link in the Intro, last subsection on grazing management in the NBR. Do I need to put a reminder here? -->

Livestock type affected plant functional group cover in our grassland sites (@fig-grazingR3s A), as we observed higher cover of Poaceae in cattle-grazed fields (**paper II**) (@fig-grazingR3s C) and a weak association between cryptogam cover and sheep-grazed fields (**paper III**) (@fig-grazingR3s B).
These findings may indicate a higher trampling disturbance and/or a more intensive land use in cattle-grazed sites, which would favour fast-growing graminoids over the more sensitive bryophyte layer [@kiddImpacts120Years2017; @ludvikovaLongTermDefoliation2014].
However, neither of these hypotheses are supported by our correlation analysis between field management and the fine-scale environment, which showed instead a weak positive association between bulk density and sheep grazing and no link between livestock type and phosphorus availability (**paper III**).

Contrary to @tothLivestockTypeMore2016, we found no evidence of greater forage selectivity or lower vascular plant species richness in sites grazed by smaller livestock (**paper II**) (@fig-grazingR3s D).
The visual observation of plant community structure could suggest a species-specific divergence between cattle grazing and sheep or goat grazing (@fig-grazingR3com A and C), showing for instance lower cover of *Agrostis capillaris* (@fig-grazingR3com B) and higher cover of *Trifolium repens* (@fig-grazingR3com D) in cattle-grazed fields, but our correlation analyses showed no significant link between field management and dominant grass and forb assemblages (**paper III**).
These outcomes were predictable to some extent, as most studies fail to clearly capture a direct impact of livestock type on species richness [e.g. @jerrentrupLittleGrazerSpecies2015] or community composition [e.g. @cuchillohilarioForageSelectivityCattle2018; @fraserImpactSwardComposition2011] despite the evidence of different foraging behaviours and nutritional requirements between cattle, sheep and goats [@mohammedGrazingBehaviorDietary2020; @rookMatchingTypeLivestock2004].
On the other hand, dominant grass and forb assemblages were consistently correlated with a gradient of vegetation structure, which itself showed a weak correlation with the field management (**paper III**).
More specifically, species such as *Poa pratensis* and *Trifolium repens* were associated with fields with higher bryophyte cover and lower vegetation height, which themselves were marginally associated with sheep grazing and smaller grazing area.

Outcomes from both **paper II** and **paper III** thus suggest the existence of a link, at least indirect, between livestock type and plant communities in the semi-natural grasslands of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.
However, we were not able to determine the direction of this relationship, whether it would reflect livestock's direct impacts, or the farmer choice in selecting the most suitable fields according to grazer type, i. e. more productive grasslands for cattle [@nuthallIntuitiveWorldFarmers2012] (see Discussions in **paper II** and **paper III**).
This mutual interactivity between the livestock, the farmer and the environment is further discussed in the Methodological consideration section of the thesis.
Independently of these considerations, our results show that field management does not override the community variations driven by the fine-scale environment, suggesting that grazing pressure is adapted to the inherent capacity of semi-natural grasslands in the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (see Discusssion in **paper III**).

Lastly, we found no evidence of a relationship between field management and dung-associated beetle assemblages (**paper III**), despite our expectation that the Scarabaeidae family to be more represented in sites with greater dung availability, i. e. more intensively managed cattle-grazed fields [@barberoDungBeetleConservation1999; @lumaretChangesResourcesConsequences1992].
Not only did cattle-grazed fields show on average the lowest abundance of Scarabaeidae (@fig-grazingR3com F), but Scarabaeidae were only very marginally represented within the community at all (@fig-grazingR3com E).
Our study thus highlights the importance of Staphylinidae, Ptiliidae and Hydrophilidae families within the coprophilous communities [see also @daoudiCompositionPhenologyBeetle2022], especially in the Nordic region where typical "dung beetle" taxa (i.e. Scarabaeinae, Aphodiinae) are poorly represented [@artsdatabankenArtsdatabankenKunnskapsbankNaturmangfold2023].

<!-- Still, we observed that the abundance of dung-associated beetle family was more sensitive to landscape-scale land use than field-scale management (**paper III**). -->
<!-- The impact of domestic grazing on grassland communities is particularly challenging to assess in observational studies, which are limited by strong variance at the same time inherent to the local environment and induced by the grazing management [@fynnManagingBrowsingGrazing2019; @wragePhytodiversityTemperatePermanent2011]. -->
<!-- In the small-scale grazing systems of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, both the low intensity of the grazing pressure and the diversity of management practices amplify context-dependency [@aldayEffectsLongtermRemoval2021; @bohnStrengthsKSelectionShape2014; @conradiResourceAvailabilityDetermines2017] (see Discussion in **paper III**). -->
<!-- Overall, we could not identify the specific drivers of biodiversity and ecosystem service delivery in the semi-natural grasslands of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. -->
<!-- which is to be imputed at least partially to the limitations of our study design. -->
<!-- We thus recommend a more thorough analysis of plant and especially arthropod communities [@losvikHayMeadowCommunities1993; @lyonsImpactsContrastingConservation2017], but under the condition of adapting the methodological framework to the local environmental context and the rotational management dynamics [@germanRelationshipsMultipleAspects2017; @sinclairOptionsContextApproach2019]. -->

### (Q2-2) What is the effect of prescribed burning on taxonomic and functional diversity in semi-natural heathlands (paper I, paper IV)?

In Hopøyna coastal outfield, prescribed burning reduced beetle alpha diversity at the patch level (**paper I**).
This result was expected, as fire disturbance generates a simplification of the ecological niche by removing the vegetation cover and homogenising fine-scale conditions [@bulanEffectsTwoAcute1971].
However, prescribed burning did not significantly increased patch beta-diversity, contrary to previous findings [@bargmannEffectsPrescribedBurning2015; @brunbjergDisturbanceDryCoastal2015].
We observed a divergence in beetle active assemblage between pioneer and mature heath patches (@fig-grazingR2 A):
recently burnt patches were associated with xerophilous and sun-loving species, while mature patches were associated with strict hygrophilous species.
At the scale of our study site, our findings thus show that prescribed burning favours the activity of beetle specialists associated with dry and exposed micro-habitats (see Discussion in **paper I**).
Similarly to @schirmelResponseCarabidBeetles2011 and @bargmannSpeciesTraitSelection2016, we added to the evidence that moisture and vegetation cover preferences are good ecological predictors of species occurrences after fire disturbance.
We were also able to determine new indicator species of pioneer and mature heath stages, especially among non-Carabidae, addressing current knowledge gaps on the effect of fire on arthropod taxa (see Discussion in **paper I**) [@rittlTraditionalNorwegianFarming2025; @yekwayoOnlyMultitaxonStudies2018].

In **paper IV**, coastal heathlands showed the highest between-site divergence compared with subalpine heathlands and grasslands (@fig-grazingR2 B).
As three sites out of five were managed with prescribed burning, this finding suggests that fire contributed to increase functional disparity between coastal heathlands.
Our results add to the evidence that traditional prescribed burning enhances habitat heterogeneity at regional scale [@velleDoesPrescribedBurning2014], supporting the resilience of heathland ecosystems to changing conditions [@haugumCoastalHeathlandVegetation2021].

<!-- Public support is usually motivated by the conservation interest of semi-natural heathlands as red-listed habitats [@hovstadKystlyngheiSeminaturligNorsk2018]. -->
<!-- More attention should also by given to the additional benefits provided by traditional management practices on nutrient-poor areas, such as the delivery of regulating and cultural services [@kopittkeAgeManagedHeathland2013; @liLongtermTemporalPatterns2023] (see Discussion in **paper IV**). -->

## (Q3) What are the synergies and trade-offs between indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem services among semi-natural grasslands and heathlands (paper II, paper IV)?

Our sites showed a wide range of plant species richness across the agroecological landscape of the fjord region (@fig-grazingR1 A).
As expected, we observed a productivity-diversity trade-off between semi-natural grasslands and heathlands (**paper IV**).
Semi-natural grasslands were characterised by better forage quality, which was represented by higher forb biomass, while semi-natural heathlands showed the highest plant species richness, which was essentially driven by cryptogam diversity (@fig-grazingR1 B).
This trade-off mostly reflects the life strategies associated with dominant selective pressures, i.e. competition for light in more fertile fields and stress-resistance in nutrient-poor habitats [@conradiResourceAvailabilityDetermines2017; @olffEffectsHerbivoresGrassland1998] (see Discussion in **paper IV**).

Semi-natural heathlands also showed higher soil carbon content than semi-natural grasslands, independently of geographical location (@fig-grazingR1 C).
Furthermore, high cryptogam diversity contributes to a wide range of regulating services [@eldridgeGlobalContributionSoil2023], including water retention capacity [@huStructuralCharacteristicsMoss2023; @michelSpeciesTraitsTheir2012] and soil stability [@silvaEffectMossCrusts2019].
These findings emphasize the conservation benefits of nutrient-poor habitats, for which lower carrying capacity is compensated by higher contribution to regulating services [@huStructuralCharacteristicsMoss2023; @quinCallunaVulgarisdominatedUpland2015] (see Discussion in **paper IV**).
Overall, our study in **paper IV** highlights that, at least to a certain extent, trade-offs are inherent for the different field types, showing that multifunctionality in agroecological landscapes relies on multiple and complementary land uses [@kremenLandscapesThatWork2018; @schilsPermanentGrasslandsEurope2022].

In **paper II**, we found that the nectar resource indicator was positively correlated with vascular plant species richness in semi-natural grasslands.
Our finding thus add to the evidence that plant diversity supports the delivery of the pollination service by ensuring the provision of pollinator food resource [@goulnikFloralTraitFunctional2020; @heglandRelationshipsDensityDiversity2006].
We also observed a positive correlation between the nectar resource indicator and the forage resource indicator (@fig-grazingR1 D), even if the latter was not directly correlated with vascular plant species richness.
This synergy suggests that the biodiversity-productivity relationship in the semi-natural grasslands of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve is currently maintained in a win-win space [@balfourTradeoffPollinatorwildflowerDiversity2025; @gongBiodiversityYieldTradeoffs2022; @ravettoenriBiodiversityfriendlyRotationalGrazing2017].

<!-- We found also that Carabidae and Hydrophilidae were more abundant in grasslands surrounded by higher relative cover of forested areas (**paper III**), suggesting a potential diversification process from the landscape matrix [@avironCarabidAssemblagesAgricultural2005; @vanbergenEffectLanduseHeterogeneity2005]. -->
<!-- At the same time though, semi-natural grasslands showed lower performance than coastal and subalpine heathlands in other regulating services, such as carbon storage or water retention (see Discussion in **paper IV**). -->

# Methodological considerations {#sec-methconsi}

## Heterogeneity and spatiotemporal variability in the Nordhordland agroecological landscape

Our investigation of the small-scale grazing systems of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve highlighted the key role of three main factors:
<!-- The small-scale grazing systems of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve result from mutual interactions between three main factors: -->
1) a strong environmental context, characterised by overlapping oceanity and elevation gradients (**paper IV**);
2) the grazing animal, driving direct foraging and trampling pressures on the field (**paper II**, **paper III**);
and 3) the farmer, who organises management at the field and farm scales (**paper I**, **paper III**).
<!-- An example of co-dependent interactions between the environment, the livestock and the farmer could be described as follows: -->
Our findings suggested that the independent influences of the environmental gradients and field management on the diversity and community composition of semi-natural grasslands were mediated by their mutual interactions at different spatial scales (**paper II**, **paper III**) (@fig-flowconcept).
At the regional and landscape scales, the climate and topography determines the foraging capacity of ecosystems [@fridleyLongerGrowingSeasons2016] (@fig-flowconcept **1**).
In response, the farmer adapts the type (e.g. grazing, fertilisation), intensity (e.g. stocking density) and spatiotemporal dynamic (e.g. field area, occupation period) of management, using for example rotational grazing in semi-natural grasslands, year-round grazing with prescribed burning in coastal heathlands or summer transhumance in mountain ranges [@austadHumaninfluencedVegetationTypes1991; @indrelidFarmingSystemIts1988] (@fig-flowconcept **2**).
The coupled influences of the environmental gradients and farmer management (e.g. fertilisation) determine the distribution of nutrients and biomass at field scale, which in turns affects the livestock foraging behaviour [@hesterForagingBehaviourSheep1999] (@fig-flowconcept **3**).
Within the field, the animal removes aboveground biomass and redistributes nutrients through urine and dung, leading a key role in the ecosystem's energy cycle [@mayelHowDoesGrassland2021; @sittersImpactsBrowsingGrazing2019] (@fig-flowconcept **4**).
Over time, the farmer adapts management according to the livestock production and the fields' capacity to recover [@hylandFactorsInfluencingDairy2018; @robertProcessesAdaptationFarm2016], subsequently renewing the grazer-environment relationship at both the field and landscape scales (@fig-flowconcept **5**).
Whilst predictable to some extent, these three-ways interactions still involve a high level of stochasticity due to the high environmental variability, the partial randomness in livestock foraging patterns, and the relative subjectivity in the farmer's decision-making [@nuthallIntuitiveWorldFarmers2012].
This creates particularly high levels of variance, which were not explicitly accounted for in our study design and analytical approaches.

<!-- (a) At landscape scale, the climate and topography determine patterns of habitat productivity limiting the exploitation of forage resources [@fridleyLongerGrowingSeasons2016; @huangAirTemperatureOptima2019]; -->
<!-- (b) In response, the farmer frames the intensity (e.g. number of animals, fertilisation) and the spatio-temporal dynamics (e.g. field area, occupation period) of the grazing pressure across fields [@hylandFactorsInfluencingDairy2018; @robertProcessesAdaptationFarm2016]; -->
<!-- (c) Within the field unit, the topography and the farmer management determine nutrient availability and biomass production [@maestreAmountPatternGrassland2007], which in turns affect the livestock movement and foraging strategies [@fynnManagingBrowsingGrazing2019; @hesterForagingBehaviourSheep1999]; -->
<!-- (d) The grazing process initiates an energy cycle between the livestock, which removes biomass and redistributes nutrients through urine and dung, and the grassland system [@mayelHowDoesGrassland2021; @sittersImpactsBrowsingGrazing2019]; -->
<!-- (e) The farmer adapts the level of disturbance or the nutrient supply in response of the field capacity to recover [@nuthallIntuitiveWorldFarmers2012; @robertProcessesAdaptationFarm2016]; -->
<!-- (f) The transfer of livestock across multiple grazing fields drives a subtle but continuous renewal of the landscape mosaic over the years [@parsonsSpatialHeterogeneityGrazing2003]. -->

## Limitations of our study design and analytical approaches

<!-- The complex multi-interactivity within small-scale grazing systems generates particularly high levels of variance, which were not explicitly accounted for in our study design and analytical approaches. -->
We can highlight four major limitations in our methodological approaches:

**(1) Environmental heterogeneity.**
We essentially approached the environmental context of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve as a broad and unidirectional west-east gradient, while overlooking the spatial heterogeneity associated with fjord shape, direction, width and steepness [@bennieInfluenceSlopeAspect2006; @graaeStayGoHow2018; @steinEnvironmentalHeterogeneityUniversal2014].
In **paper III** especially, it could have been relevant to include at least one measure of topographic complexity [e.g. variance of elevation or slope, see @yuMultiscaleComparisonTopographic2015] in the regional-scale explanatory set, which included site elevation as the only landform-related variable.
**(2) Livestock-driven heterogeneity at the field scale.**
Despite the nested sampling design of our ecological study, we did not attempt to investigate sward patchiness in response to livestock foraging [@tonnGrazingInducedPatchiness2019].
In **paper II **, we could have compared the within-field variation of forage and nectar resource values according to grazer types [@duquetteSpatiallyDiscreteDisturbance2022].
In **paper III**, including an indicator of sward heterogeneity may have increased the explanatory power of the correlation analyses between grazing management and the fine-scale environment [@ravettoenriBiodiversityfriendlyRotationalGrazing2017].
**(3) Management-driven heterogeneity at the landscape scale.**
The versatility of the rotational management caused practical limitations for quantifying individual field-scale factors such as stocking density (see Discussion in **paper III**).
We therefore questioned the accuracy of field-level assessments in capturing the spatio-temporal dynamics driven by the rotations, similarly to how, in **paper I**, an investigation at patch level may not have been representative of the mosaic effect driven by rotational prescribed burning [@tammeEnvironmentalHeterogeneitySpecies2010; @steinEnvironmentalHeterogeneityUniversal2014] (see Discussion in **paper I**).
**(4) Biological indicators accuracy.**
Greater indicator sensitivity may have been necessary to capture community responses to grazing management under low disturbance regimes.
Arthropod taxa especially were investigated at rather coarse taxonomic resolution, only down to family-level for beetles in **paper III** and order-level for mesofauna in **paper IV** [@daoudiCompositionPhenologyBeetle2022].
While morphological identification requires a considerable investment of time, resource and expertise, novel DNA methods show great potential for facilitating the investigating of soil fauna [@geisenMethodologicalFrameworkEmbrace2019; @sigsgaardEnvironmentalDNAMetabarcoding2021].

## Optimising the study design towards transdisciplinary farm-level assessments of multifunctionality

Ecological research can support the functionality and resilience of agroecological systems by providing actionable knowledge for the implementation of sustainable management practices [@altieriLinkingEcologistsTraditional2004; @bardgettCombattingGlobalGrassland2021; @gardnerAgriculturalResiliencePerspectives2019].
However, for this knowledge to be representative, comprehensive and applicable in consideration of the local context and stakeholders, research standards should be revised towards more holistic approaches [@sinclairOptionsContextApproach2019].
Key methodological aspects should include:
(1) spatially-explicit analyses, in order to identify the processes driving variance in agroecological systems [@petersCrossScaleInteractions2007] and to disentangle the respective influences of management and the environmental gradients [e.g. @wittmanSocialEcologicalPerspective2017; @redlichDisentanglingEffectsClimate2022];
(2) landscape-scale approaches, with the farm as the main reference unit, to address environmental and management-driven variance not as a bias but as an inherent determinant of agroecological systems [@cloughFieldSizesFuture2020; @deffontainesAgriculturalSystemsLandscape1995; @sinclairOptionsContextApproach2019] (see Discussion in **paper III**);
(3) high resolution indicators, with priority given to taxa contributing to key ecosystem functions such as soil fauna [@bardgettBelowgroundBiodiversityEcosystem2014; @degraaffEffectsAgriculturalIntensification2019], while avoiding groups based on fuzzy definitions unless their dominance in the local context has been confirmed (see Discussion in **paper III**).

<!-- Methodological frameworks should rely on spatially-explicit analyses, favouring resolution over replication and objective-based guidelines over ready-made indicators [@kremenLandscapesThatWork2018; @wittmanSocialEcologicalPerspective2017]. -->
<!-- To address variance not as a bias but as an inherent determinant of agroecological systems, the study design should rely on the farm instead of the field as a reference unit (see Discussion in **paper III**) [@cloughFieldSizesFuture2020; @deffontainesAgriculturalSystemsLandscape1995; @sinclairOptionsContextApproach2019]. -->
<!-- Implicit to this choice is a landscape perspective [@leprovostContrastingResponsesBelowground2021; @leprovostSupplyMultipleEcosystem2022; @tscharntkeLandscapePerspectivesAgricultural2005], which integrates spatial arrangement and connectivity not only as tangible patches and corridors [@baileyInfluenceThematicResolution2007; @evjuSpatialConfigurationMatters2016], but also as flows of energy and disturbance driven by the farmer decision-making [@deffontainesAgriculturalSystemsLandscape1995]. -->
<!-- The inclusion of multiple spatial scales is crucial to identify key processes driving variance in agroecological systems [@petersCrossScaleInteractions2007] and to disentangle the respective influences of management and the environmental gradients [e.g. @wittmanSocialEcologicalPerspective2017; @redlichDisentanglingEffectsClimate2022]. -->
<!-- The determination of suitable indicators requires a more thorough investigation of grassland and heathland communities, as the existence of optimal surrogates of biodiversity response to grazing management has yet to reach consensus [@bucherBiodiversityLowintensityPastures2016; @neffCrossscaleEffectsLand2019]. -->
<!-- Priority should be given to taxa contributing to key ecosystem functions [@balSelectingIndicatorSpecies2018], but I advise caution for selecting target groups based on fuzzy definitions (e.g. the dung beetle paraphyletic group), unless their dominance in the local context has been confirmed (see Discussion in **paper III**). -->
<!-- I particularly recommend to dedicate more attention to the soil system, as scientific evidence on the role of soil organisms in ecosystem multifunctionality is accumulating rapidly, but considerable knowledge gaps remain [@bardgettBelowgroundBiodiversityEcosystem2014; @degraaffEffectsAgriculturalIntensification2019; @wangDiversifyingLivestockPromotes2019]. -->

Last but not least, ensuring the pertinence, applicability and accessibility of agroecological research requires the active involvement of the farmers as knowledge-holders, decision-makers and managers [@bennettLinkingBiodiversityEcosystem2015; @jagerPathwaysImplementationEvidence2020; @rockstromSustainableIntensificationAgriculture2017].
However, several principles should be respected to guarantee inclusive, open, transparent and equitable collaboration in the long-term [@stringerUnpackingParticipationAdaptive2006].
First, farmer knowledge built from empirical, context-specific and community-based learning is as legitimate as and inherently complementary to the fundamental, generalised and discipline-based academic knowledge of scientists [@altieriLinkingEcologistsTraditional2004; @nuthallIntuitiveWorldFarmers2012; @shiSocialInteractionEffect2021].
We ourselves directly witnessed the considerable capacity of the farmers, and more particularly the elders, to recollect details of management history not only for their own fields, but also for the surrounding agricultural landscape [@ianniRevitalizingTraditionalEcological2015].
<!-- Transdisciplinary research is still a vast field to explore [@lacombeDesigningAgroecologicalFarming2018],  -->
Second, research concepts should be discussed, adapted and validated over a common understanding between farmers and scientists [@dickStakeholdersPerspectivesOperationalisation2018; @dramstadIntegratingLandscapebasedValues2001], with priority given to the ones already assimilated in policy-making [@bjorkhaugMultifunctionalAgriculturePolicy2008; @kremenLandscapesThatWork2018].
For instance, @lamarqueHowEcosystemServices2014 showed that, even though farmers were already able to integrate ecosystem services they were familiar with in their decision-making, they still gained from raised awareness on the least known regulating services (i.e. nitrogen leaching, carbon storage).
Lastly, farmer values should be thoroughly identified and associated with the different social groups representing the rural community [@bernuesSeeingNorthernEuropean2016; @busckFarmersLandscapeDecisions2002; @cusensMappingConnectionsIntegrated2023].
The pragmatic approach of farmers driven by material considerations and socioeconomic constraints is essential for assessing the feasibility of scientific recommendations [@marenDiversifiedFarmingSystems2022; @wehnAdaptiveBiodiversityManagement2018].

## Perspectives for the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve

The Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve has a key role in initiating and mediating knowledge co-production between farmers, managers, scientists and policy-makers [@bohnetCocreatingCulturalNarratives2025; @jagerPathwaysImplementationEvidence2020; @lacombeDesigningAgroecologicalFarming2018].
Even though our ecological study assumed a relatively standard, non-participatory research framework, we still aimed to bring a modest contribution to the development of trust and mutual understanding between farmers and scientists.
As a token of gratitude for their involvement, we delivered a personalised pamphlet to each farmer summarising the biological and environmental data collected on their fields.
We also produced a generic version of the pamphlet, based on the whole dataset, for disseminating research achievements with the Biosphere Reserve framework to the general public and promoting our work to potential partners (see Appendix).
From the TradMod project as the first stepping stone [see @cusensParticipatoryMappingReveals2022; @cusensIntegrationMattersCombining2023], the team led by the UNESCO Chair on Sustainable Heritage and Environmental Management is working to expand transdisciplinary research for the sustainable use of land resources in the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve [@barracloughMappingStakeholderNetworks2022; @bohnetCocreatingCulturalNarratives2025].

# Conclusion {#sec-conclusion}

<!-- The industrialised livestock production system inherited from the Green Revolution has failed to ensure global food security, while largely contributing to the current ecological crisis [@bardgettCombattingGlobalGrassland2021; @ramankuttyTrendsGlobalAgricultural2018]. -->
Exploring farming alternatives based on agroecological principles has become a priority to ensure the livelihood of local communities, support the sustainable use of land resources and preserve the integrity of ecosystems [@altieriPerspectivesChallengesAgroecology2024; @ipbesThematicAssessmentReport2024; @kremenLandscapesThatWork2018].
This thesis aimed to contribute to this objective by using the small-scale grazing systems of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, Western Norway, as a case study.
I assessed how semi-natural grasslands and heathlands supported biodiversity and ecosystem services delivery, by investigating
1) the effect of the regional environment on habitat productivity and the composition of grassland communities;
2) the impact of livestock type and prescribed burning on the diversity and composition of semi-natural grasslands and heathlands respectively;
and 3) synergies and trade-offs across the agroecological landscape of the fjord region.

I confirmed that agricultural land use in the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve is still largely determined by the environment of the fjord region (**paper III**, **paper IV**).
I demonstrated the biological and functional complementarity of semi-natural grasslands and heathlands (**paper IV**), adding to the evidence that win-win strategies promoting biodiversity and multifunctionality in food production systems are already within our reach [@gardnerAgriculturalResiliencePerspectives2019; @kremenLandscapesThatWork2018].
I particularly emphasized the conservation benefits of semi-natural heathlands in 
coastal and mountainous areas, which showed a remarkable diversity of cryptogam species and supported the delivery of carbon and water regulating services (**paper IV**).
I highlighted the role of traditional prescribed burning in enhancing functional diversity locally (**paper I**) [@bargmannSpeciesTraitSelection2016] and supporting ecosystem heterogeneity regionally (**paper IV**) [@velleDoesPrescribedBurning2014].
In semi-natural grasslands, I showed that field management did not override the variations of plant communities driven by the fine-scale environment (**paper III**).
I also demonstrated that, independently of livestock type, these grassland communities were characterised by synergies between vascular plant species richness and nectar resource, and between forage resource and nectar resource (**paper II**).
However, except for cattle grazing which was associated with higher Poaceae cover, independent effects of management factors on plant and beetle communities were at most marginal (**paper II**, **paper III**).
Likewise, I was unable to detect a direct influence of the regional environment on the diversity and composition of semi-natural grasslands (**paper III**, **paper IV**).
I therefore recommend to conduct further research to investigate more thoroughly the interactions between the farmer, the livestock and the environment in the small-scale grazing systems of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.
Understanding these relationships will have essential implications for the conservation of 
the agricultural landscape and the development of a sustainable food production pathway in Western Norway.

<!-- In these perspectives, the lack of divergence between coastal and fjord grasslands should be verified with a broader and more thorough analysis of plant communities,  -->
<!-- If this lack of divergence is verified, it could indicate an homogenisation driven by the generalised intensification of grazing management over time [@gossnerLanduseIntensificationCauses2016; @pakemanIncreasedGrazingDrives2021] (see Discussion in **paper IV**). -->
<!-- showed that grazing management adapted to the capacity of ecosystems allows the spontaneous expression of natural communities (**paper III**), favouring the functional complementarity between semi-natural habitats (**paper IV**) [@gardnerAgriculturalResiliencePerspectives2019; @tscharntkeOrganicFarmingHarnessing2021]. -->
<!-- As such, low-intensity domestic grazing supported plant diversity and synergies between forage and nectar resources in semi-natural grasslands, independently of the livestock type and the farm structure (**paper II**) [@bengtssonGrasslandsMoreImportant2019]. -->
<!-- I also highlighted the crucial role of traditional management practices, such as prescribed burning, for the conservation of heathland ecosystems and their contributions to biodiversity and regulating services (**paper I**, **paper IV**) [@walmsleyEnsuringLongtermProvision2021]. -->

Diversified management strategies ensure the resilience of the food production systems by promoting biodiversity and synergies at local and regional scales [@altieriPerspectivesChallengesAgroecology2024; @rasmussenJointEnvironmentalSocial2024].
<!-- Priorities are to support the viability and diversity of farming models by emphasizing the value of non-marketable commodities, for instance those associated with cultural heritage (e.g. rustic breeds, traditional farming practices) [@marenDiversifiedFarmingSystems2022; @wezelAgroecologicalPrinciplesElements2020]. -->
<!-- by for instance emphasizing the value of the production of commodities associated with cultural heritage such as rustic breeds (e.g. *Gammel Norsk Sau*) or traditional summer farming (**paper IV**) [@asheimPolicyMeasuresPreserve2020; @kvakkestadNorwegianFarmersPerspectives2015; @potthoffNorwegianLowintensityOvine2023]. -->
We encourage further research efforts to investigate already existing models of small-scale farming systems, which are indispensable sources of knowledge for understanding how adaptative management strategies interact with the local context [@bardgettCombattingGlobalGrassland2021; @sinclairOptionsContextApproach2019].
To that end, ecological research must explore transdisciplinary approaches and involve local communities as part of the knowledge co-production processes [@barracloughMappingStakeholderNetworks2022; @bohnetCocreatingCulturalNarratives2025; @jagerPathwaysImplementationEvidence2020].
