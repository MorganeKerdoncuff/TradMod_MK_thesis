# Introduction & context - Food production & food availability at a global & regional scales

# Small-scale grazing systems and cultural landscape

## Cultural landscapes and traditional agriculture

- Even in small-scale systems, changes in management with the use of fertilizers and seed mixtures. In our case, only 4 of our infields were without any sort of treatment apart from grazing.

## Biodiversity associated with low-intensity grazing systems & current trends

## Western Norway and Nordhordland Biosphere Reserve context

# Diversity and functionality across scale

## When farmers shape the landscape matrix biodiversity

### The agricultural landscape matrix and the farm 

### PAPER III ("NBR-grazers") - When the farmer unintentionnally creates and interacts with the mosaic

### PAPER I ("ØY") - When the farmer intentionally creates the mosaic

## Functionality of the field system

### PAPER IV ("SHEEP") - Within the field

### PAPER II ("MORGANE D") - From functions to services
