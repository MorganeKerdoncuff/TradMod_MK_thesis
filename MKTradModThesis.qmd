# Abstract in English

As scientific evidence keeps on demonstrating the unprecedented environmental footprint of agriculture worldwide, research effort should more than ever be engaged towards multifunctional farming systems, ensuring at the same time sustainable food production, biodiversity conservation and the delivery of multiple ecosystem services. 
In the fjord region of Western Norway, a long history of domestic grazing characterised by versatile, low-intensive management strategies has shaped the landscape from the coast to the mountain ranges into a fine mosaic of semi-natural grasslands and heathlands of high ecological and cultural values. 
Following the post-WW2 rationalisation of livestock production though, the countryside was subjected to concomitant processes of intensification on more fertile fields and abandonment on remote areas, resulting in a generalised decline of farming and a loss of grazing-dependent habitats.
In this context, the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve was designated as a model area for exploring pathways for sustainable land use in Western Norway preserving the ecological diversity of the agricultural landscape while ensuring the resilience of the food production system.
Using this framework, I led an exploratory ecological study on 42 grazing fields distributed across the fjord system of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve to assess the potential of domestic grazing for enhancing biodiversity and ensuring the delivery of multiple ecosystem services. 
More specifically, I investigated (1) the influence of the west-east gradient from the coast to the mountains in determining habitat productivity and land use and (2) the effects of management, including livestock type, stocking density and rotational prescribed burning, on the diversity, community composition and ecosystem services of semi-natural grasslands and heathlands.

I confirmed that the climate-landform gradient of the fjord system generated a hump-shaped productivity pattern constraining land use on the coastline and in the mountains, but had only limited influence within more fertile ranges compared with local topographic and edaphic conditions.
Grazing management promoted plant diversity, ecosystem service synergies and land use complementarity across the agro-ecological landscape: I observed a positive correlation between nectar resource and forage resource in semi-natural grasslands, while semi-natural heathlands showed higher species richness and soil carbon content.  
On coastal heathlands, rotational prescribed burning locally favoured xerophilous and sun-loving beetles and contributed to ecosystem heterogeneity at regional scale. 
However, there was only little evidence of the independent effects of management on grassland communities: if I observed higher grass cover in cattle-grazed fields and seemingly higher bryophyte cover in sheep-grazing fields, there were still many inconsistent results questioning the link of causality between livestock types and biodiversity patterns.
I emphasized the limitation of our study design for capturing the complex multi-interactivity between the environment, the livestock and the farm and the inherent spatio-temporal variability of the small-scale grazing systems of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.
I recommend the development of farm-level assessments based on flexible methodological frameworks and trans-disciplinary approaches, as collaborative knowledge-building and decision-making within the framework of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve show as the most suitable pathways for ensuring the continuity and the ecological integrity of the small-scale grazing systems in Western Norway.

# Introduction 

<!-- ## The role of Norwegian small-scale grazing systems in the current global food security challenge -->
## A new paradigm to address the global food security challenge

Should we produce more to sustain more people on the planet? When facing the upcoming global food security challenge [@kastnerGlobalChangesDiets2012; @moraExploringFutureLand2020; @vanmeijlModellingAlternativeFutures2020], with a food demand expected to increase between 30% and 62% by 2050 [@vandijkMetaanalysisProjectedGlobal2021], the initial temptation to dive into a "crop-mania" has raised some warnings [@foleySolutionsCultivatedPlanet2011; @hunterAgriculture2050Recalibrating2017]. 
First, the prevalent issue is less a matter of gross production capacity than severe North-South inequalities in its redistribution and availability [@cassidyRedefiningAgriculturalYields2013; @fischerLandSparingLand2014; @tscharntkeGlobalFoodSecurity2012; @westLeveragePointsImproving2014]. 
Second, there is only very limited potential for the expansion of agricultural lands without conflicting with other land uses [@kimMappingEnvironmentalLand2018; @liSpatialConflictIdentification2023; @zabelGlobalAgriculturalLand2014] or damaging to a critical extent the biodiversity and functionality of natural and semi-natural ecosystems [@beckmannConventionalLandUse2019; @foleyGlobalConsequencesLand2005; @newboldGlobalEffectsLand2015; @newboldHasLandUse2016]. 
The livestock sector bears high responsibilities for the latter, as globalised grain-feed systems have steadily replaced pasture-based husbandry following the Green Revolution [@kastnerGlobalChangesDiets2012; @ramankuttyTrendsGlobalAgricultural2018]. 
This transition provided overall relatively poor return in calorie supply [@cassidyRedefiningAgriculturalYields2013] and economic profitability for the farmers [@garibaldiFarmingApproachesGreater2017; @jeanneretIncreaseFoodProduction2021], but was at the cost of massive land appropriation and severe environmental externalities in the Global South [@cunninghamCloseYieldgapSaving2013; @hongGlobalRegionalDrivers2021; @naylorLosingLinksLivestock2005] and of widespread decrease and degradation of global grassland area [@bardgettCombattingGlobalGrassland2021; @liuAnnualDynamicsGlobal2020; @piipponenGlobalTrendsGrassland2022; @wirseniusHowMuchLand2010], particularly in Europe [@auneLossSeminaturalGrassland2018; @schilsPermanentGrasslandsEurope2022].

To shift away from this trajectory which places dramatic pressure on the Earth limits [@pelletierForecastingPotentialGlobal2010; @richardsonEarthSixNine2023], a new dominant paradigm has emerged during the past decade that acknowledges the synergy between food security, ecosystem integrity and human well-being and thus defends the potentiality of win-win alternatives [@fischerReframingFoodBiodiversity2017; @hanspachTradeoffsSynergiesFood2017; @wittmanSocialEcologicalPerspective2017]. 
These approaches have materialised through different concepts - e.g. agroecology [@holt-gimenezAgroecologyFoodSovereignty2012; @wezelAgroecologicalPrinciplesElements2020], diversified farming [@kremenDiversifiedFarmingSystems2012; @rosa-schleichEcologicaleconomicTradeoffsDiversified2019] or sustainable intensification [@prettySustainableIntensificationAgricultural2014; @rockstromSustainableIntensificationAgriculture2017] - that explore a wide range of management practices but share the consensus that food production should be diversified [@billenReshapingEuropeanAgrofood2021; @petersen-rockneyNarrowBrittleBroad2021] and tailored to the local context [@cunninghamCloseYieldgapSaving2013; @prettySustainableIntensificationAgricultural2014] to support self-sufficient and resilient socio-ecological systems [@chappellFoodSecurityBiodiversity2011; @gardnerAgriculturalResiliencePerspectives2019]. 
The realisation of this new agricultural pathway thus requires an extensive effort of policy-oriented research across multiple ecosystems and socio-cultural backgrounds to investigate ecological interactions and trade-offs under different farming models [@egliWinnersLosersNational2018; @rockstromSustainableIntensificationAgriculture2017; @runhaarFourCriticalConditions2021].

## The UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere Programme

Launched in 1971, the Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Programme, from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), aims to engage trans-disciplinary and action-based research to "improve human livelihoods, and the equitable sharing of benefits, and to safeguard natural and managed ecosystems, promoting innovative approaches to economic development that are socially and culturally appropriate and environmentally sustainable" [@ManBiosphereProgramme2025; @unescoNewRoadmapMan2017]. 
This mission has been carried out since 1976 through the World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR), which as of January 2025 encompasses 759 sites distributed across 136 countries and represents a total population of about 275 million people [@ManBiosphereProgramme2025]. 
Biosphere Reserves (BRs) are designated over a wide range of terrestrial and/or marine ecosystems as model areas for experimenting innovative pathways for sustainable development, with the successive strategies of the MAB Programme as references [@barracloughGlobalKnowledgeAction2023; @unescoNewRoadmapMan2017]. 
The latest 2015-2025 MAB Strategy and the Lima Action Plan (2016-2025) are for instance in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) from the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in order to facilitate the integration of BRs practical learning in national policy-making and international collaboration [@unescoLimaActionPlan2016; @unitednationsTransformingOurWorld2015]. 
Concretely, research in BRs has been particularly useful to identify synergies, conflicts and challenges over land use, in both current socio-ecological contexts [e.g. @cusensParticipatoryMappingReveals2022; @tamouPastoralistsChangingEnvironment2018] and future projections [e.g. @konigUNESCOBiosphereReserves2022; @ruiz-mallenParticipatoryScenariosExplore2015], and to monitor the efficiency of environmental measures and socio-economic investments [e.g. @kratzerRuralInnovationsBiosphere2019].

<!-- - to ensure human prosperity and equity through the sustainable use of natural resources and the conservation of ecosystems -->
<!-- A suited framework for collecting and sharing practical knowledge on sustainable food production -->

## The Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve as a case study

In Western Norway, the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve was designated to "be based on the best from the past and [...] pave the way for a future-oriented societal development that ensures the sustainable use of all types of resources for the benefit and pleasure of both the present inhabitants and future generations" [@kalandNordhordlandBiosphereReserve2018]. 
Agriculture in the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve indeed carries a strong legacy of low-intensive rotational grazing that has shaped a typical mosaic-like landscape hosting a remarkable biodiversity [@austadHumaninfluencedVegetationTypes1991; @olssonAgroecosystemsNeolithicTime1991]. 
This ecological exception is tightly connected to the constraining environment of the Norwegian fjords [@ketzlerClimateNorway2021; @nesjeFjordsNorwayComplex2009], which has limited the potential for mechanisation and thus prevented a radical transformation of the countryside [@fjellstadPatternsChangeTwo1999]. 
However, the second half of the XX^th^ century was still marked by a steady process of rationalisation of the livestock production which favoured farm specialisation and led to a general reorganisation of rural areas, with on one hand the enlargement and intensification of fertile fields and on the other hand the abandonment of remote, low-productive lands [@jonesLandtenureLandscapeChange1988; @hamreLandcoverStructuralChanges2007]. 
These concurring processes were further aggravated by the overall decrease of farming activity caused by the socio-economic decline and the ageing population of rural communities [@forbordDriversChangeNorwegian2014; @potthoffNorwegianLowintensityOvine2023], with a bigger impact on small holdings (<10 ha) which dropped from 90% of total Norwegian farms in 1949 to 53% in 1995 [@fjellstadPatternsChangeTwo1999; @ovreasEndringarJordbruksarealOg2011]. 
In Western Norway, this change was reflected across the whole agro-ecological landscape with woody encroachment on coastal and mountain heathlands [@brynImpactsLandUse2012; @olssonLandscapeChangePatterns2000] and the impoverishment and coarsening of the infield landscape matrix [@hamrePlantSpeciesRichness2010; @norderhaugBiotopePatternsAbundance2000].

In this context, the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve assumes a leading role for collecting practical knowledge and building partnerships which aim to (1) preserve the inherited ecological diversity associated with small-scale grazing and low-intensive management [@hamrePlantSpeciesRichness2010; @norderhaugBiotopePatternsAbundance2000] ([Box 1](#box-farming)), (2) ensure the resilience and functionality of the agro-ecological system in face of upcoming global challenges such as climate change [@liuAssessingEffectsClimate2019; @meuwissenFrameworkAssessResilience2019] and (3) support decision-making towards multi-functional farming pathways integrating food security, conservation of the environment and the socio-economic development of rural areas [@asheimPolicyMeasuresPreserve2020; @bjorkhaugMultifunctionalAgriculturePolicy2008]. 
Concretely, the BR framework offers good opportunities not only for re-assessing the ecological state of grazed habitats, as for instance detailed studies on grazed meadows particularly tend to be outdated (e.g. @losvikHayMeadowCommunities1993), but also for emancipating agricultural research in Western Norway from conservation-focused perspectives, which have so far been dominant (but see for instance @wehnAdaptiveBiodiversityManagement2018), by investigating direct and indirect benefits provided by the farmers activity [@bommarcoExploitingEcosystemServices2018; @goldsteinIntegratingEcosystemserviceTradeoffs2012].

::: {.callout-note #box-farming}
### Box 1. The taxonomy of farming systems {#box-farming}
Characterising farming systems in an accurate and reproducible way is an everlasting challenge, but nevertheless necessary to identify trade-offs from existing models [@huberFarmTypologiesUnderstanding2024]. 
Since the environmental footprint of agricultural production became a burning topic, many different terms have been used to draw opposition between the intensive, industrialised model that became predominant in the Global North, usually branded as "conventional", and more extensive, "ecology-friendly" methods commonly qualified as, among others, "organic", "alternative", "agro-ecological", "regenerative" or "traditional" [@sumbergWhatConventionalAgriculture2022]. 
If these designations can rely on explicit and practical principles [e.g. @wezelAgroecologicalPrinciplesElements2020], most of them still lack a consensual regulatory framework similar to what has been developed for organic farming [@seufertWhatThisThing2017]. 
This general fuzziness has been the cause of deeply rooted biases such as the very Western-centered "conventional" type of agriculture, which, in the dominant narrative, has been closely associated with the agricultural innovations from the Green Revolution [@sumbergWhatConventionalAgriculture2022]. 
According to the literal meaning of the term though, which strictly refers to practices that are common or generally in use in a certain geographical area and during a certain time period, there should not be inherent contradiction between "conventional" and for example "traditional" farming, which is still dominant in many part of the World [@altieriLinkingEcologistsTraditional2004].

In this thesis, I use "traditional" only to describe formerly common farming practices that have either severely declined or disappeared over time and are nowadays associated with the Norwegian cultural heritage [@daugstadAgricultureUpholderCultural2006]. 
Regarding the current dominant livestock model, the most consistent feature between farms in Western Norway is their small production scale according to Global North standards [@klikockaCharacteristicsModelsFarms2021], both in terms of net income, which was on average 164500 NOK (approx. 14400€) per holding in 2023 [@ssbFarmersIncomeDebt2025], and in terms of flock size, with on average ca. 25.3 heads of dairy cows, 11.8 heads of beef cattle, 49.7 heads of sheep over 1 year old and 110.6 heads of dairy goats per holding in 2024 [@ssbHoldingsAgriculturalArea2025]. 
I therefore use "small-scale grazing systems" to characterise domestic grazing in the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve independently of farm structure, livestock type or management practice.

*waiting for clarification before completion. To Inger & Amy: is there an equivalent to "small-scale grazing/farming system" in Norwegian? Or put in another way: how Norwegian designate what we call "small-scale grazing/farming system"?*

<!-- which has already been assimilated in Norwegian policy-making [e.g. @asheimPolicyMeasuresPreserve2020] -->
<!-- I acknowledge that this designation is still lacking in the sense that it can encompass many different models and thus may not reflect as accurately the evolution of agricultural practices in the NBR. I therefore encourage further discussion as part of the NBR management plan to determine specific terminology for the past, current and predicted stages of farming in Western Norway that will facilitate policy-making in the future [@gillerFutureFarmingWho2021; @huberFarmTypologiesUnderstanding2024]. -->
<!-- - Considering the surface area of the farm is not relevant in this context because of extensive areal use especially with free-ranging -->
<!-- - knowing that this "small-scale" does not have the same meaning between global North and global South [@jouziOrganicFarmingSmallscale2017] -->

## Accounting for the landform-climate gradient of the fjord system

Fjords are *"steep-sided, coastal erosional troughs which have been inundated by the sea"* [@howeFjordSystemsArchives2010] that originate from the ice retreat after the last glaciation [@mangerudIceflowPatternsPrecise2019]. 
The interconnection of fjords and fjord arms results into an intricate "fjord system" network (@fig-maptopo A), which can be coarsely divided into three broad landscape zones along a west-east gradient of land connectivity and elevation [@nesjeFjordsNorwayComplex2009] (@fig-maptopo B): the highly fragmented **coastal zone**, showing a "strandflat" landscape typical to the Norwegian shoreline and consisting of partially submerged and gently undulating platforms [@norgesgeologiskeundersokelseNasjonalBerggrunnsdatabase2023]; the **fjord zone**, characterised by narrower fjords, larger land areas and stronger topography, with the inner fjord area essentially encompassing steep mountain sides diving into the sea; the **mountain zone**, forming large plateaus above the tree line and up to 1300 masl [@kalandNordhordlandBiosphereReserve2018]. 
This landscape zonation is associated with strong temperature and precipitation patterns, which result from the simultaneous influences of two overlapping gradients of oceanity and elevation [@ketzlerClimateNorway2021]. 
On one hand, the warm and moist air masses brought by the Gulf stream maintain a generally mild and wet oceanic climate, whose buffering effect on temperature annual variations declines with distance-to-sea (@fig-mapclimate B). 
On the other hand, increasing elevation leads annual precipitation to intensify threefold, particularly on westerly exposed slopes (@fig-mapclimate A), and average temperature to drop down to a subpolar regime on the highest reliefs (@fig-mapclimate C and D).

Temperature and precipitation are both determinant for the production of aboveground biomass [@huangAirTemperatureOptima2019; @michaletzDriversTerrestrialPlant2018; @zhuNonlinearInteractingResponses2016] and for its quality as forage resource for livestock [@fridleyLongerGrowingSeasons2016; @sloatIncreasingImportancePrecipitation2018]. 
In subalpine areas, colder climate and shorter growth season favour stress-tolerance strategies [@diazGlobalSpectrumPlant2016] such as belowground biomass allocation [@maGlobalDistributionEnvironmental2021], reduced leaf area [@scherrerDisentanglingProcessesDriving2019] or energetic investments towards solidifying compounds (e.g. lignin) [@cornelissenLeafDigestibilityLitter2004; @pierceLeafEconomicsSpectrum2007], limiting both the availability and nutritional composition of palatable species [@mladekPlantTraitAssembly2013; @nelsonPlantFactorsAffecting1994] (@fig-landscape C). 
Contrary to temperature though, water availability is not expected to be a limiting factor in the well-irrigated Nordhordland region where average annual precipitation does not reach below 1500 mm (@fig-mapclimate A). 
However, high rainfall intensity and frequency aggravate particle runoffs on exposed and rugged grounds [@zhangNutrientLossSensitive2020] and creates, in the most extreme cases, nutrient-depleted landscapes of bedrock ridges, shrub-dominated vegetation and mires, typical to the outermost coastal strandflats [@chapinNatureNutrientLimitation1986; @winnerResponsePlantsMultiple1991] (@fig-landscape A). 
The intensity of the erosion process decreases along with the decline of the oceanic influence and the expansion of land area and sheltering reliefs across the more central, hilly lowlands of the coastal and fjord zones, increasing soil fertility and creating more suitable conditions for plant growth and landscape diversification [@ordonezGlobalStudyRelationships2009] (@fig-landscape B). 
The environmental limitation driven by the interacting influences of climate and landform thus generates a coarsely hump-shaped pattern of primary productivity along the West-East gradient of the fjord system, determining the regional-scale distributions of species and land uses [@karlsenVariabilityStartGrowing2007; @siefertScaleDependenceVegetationenvironment2012].

## Domestic grazing in the small-scale grazing systems of Western Norway

In wet regions, the effect of grazing on biodiversity is usually assumed to follow the intermediate disturbance hypothesis [@gaoCanIntermediateDisturbance2020; @milchunasGeneralizedModelEffects1988]: between two extreme states dominated by either light competitors or grazing-tolerant species [@koernerChangeDominanceDetermines2018; @olffEffectsHerbivoresGrassland1998], a moderate intensity creates a desirable stage of sward heterogeneity allowing the coexistence of the highest number of life strategies [@adlerEffectGrazingSpatial2001; @ceraboliniWhyAreMany2016]. 
Empirical evidence however shows that this relationship is not as straightforward, especially within the low-to-moderate intensity range [@herrero-jaureguiEffectsGrazingIntensity2018; @scohierHowSheepAffect2012; @wangGlobalMetaanalysesResponse2019], and is for instance mediated by habitat productivity [@lezamaVariationGrazinginducedVegetation2014; @pakemanLongTermImpacts2019]. 
In nutrient-poor habitats, the prevalence of stress-tolerance strategies, usually involving limited plant growth rate and reproductive capacities [@diazGlobalSpectrumPlant2016; @pierceLeafEconomicsSpectrum2007], increases the sensitivity of plant communities to the colonisation of ruderal and fast-growing species [@pakemanConsistencyPlantSpecies2004; @teuberLivestockGrazingIntermountain2013]. 
Still, grazing pressure is overall beneficial in low-productivity contexts when spatially diffuse, through for instance extensive or free-ranging grazing [@schneiderEffectsExtensiveGrazing2024], or temporally limited to allow vegetation recovery [@perottiYearRotationalGrazing2018; @ravettoenriBiodiversityfriendlyRotationalGrazing2017]. 
Beyond the theoretical intensity optimum is thus both the actual ecosystem capacity to sustain grazing pressure [@piipponenGlobalTrendsGrassland2022] and the reciprocal management adaptability to inherent abiotic constraints [@plieningerTraditionalLanduseNature2006; @torokGrazingEuropeanOpen2016] which shape the agro-ecological diversity of grazing systems [@bignalLowintensityFarmingSystems1996]. 
This diversity in grazing habitats and land use determines in turn the potential of the agricultural landscape not only in ensuring the resilience of the food production system [@garibaldiFarmingApproachesGreater2017], but also in supporting multiple ecosystem services [@leprovostSupplyMultipleEcosystem2022; @schilsPermanentGrasslandsEurope2022].

Kerdoncuff); (C) Goat-grazed semi-natural grassland in Morkenfjellet in the coastal area (Alver municipality, A. E. Eycott); (D) Sheep-grazed semi-natural grassland in Eikemovegen in the fjord area (Alver municipality, M. Demeaux).](illustrations/NBR_IntroGrazingPictures.png){#fig-nbrgrazing}

In Western Norway, farmers' adaptation to limited carrying capacity materialised through the former infield-outfield system prevailing before the post-WW2 agricultural transition [@christiansenInfieldoutfieldSystemsCharacteristics1978], which maximised the potential of the whole environmental gradient of the fjord system by relying on complementary management strategies between central, more productive infields and remote, less productive remote outfields ([Box 2](#box-history)). 
If the farming model and practices have since evolved, this differentiation in grazing management according to habitat productivity has been maintained. Semi-natural heathlands in remote areas are usually grazed by free-ranging sheep or goats, either all year round on the coastline [@lundbergAustevollChangingCoastal1991], or only during the short summer season in the mountain ranges to allow fertile pastures in the lowlands to recover [@olssonLandscapeChangePatterns2000]. 
Opening the sward facilitates the development of a diverse cryptogam layer [@aldayEffectsLongtermRemoval2021; @austrheimSynergiesTradeoffsEcosystem2016] and widens the range of ecological niches for arthropod communities by enhancing structural heterogeneity [@dennisResponseSpiderAraneae2015; @steinEnvironmentalHeterogeneityUniversal2014]. 
Nutrient-poor and water-saturated conditions are limiting for forage production, but the reduced biological activity and the dominance of cryptogams contribute on the other hand to multiple regulating services such as carbon sequestration [@liLongtermTemporalPatterns2023; @quinCallunaVulgarisdominatedUpland2015] or water regulation [@huStructuralCharacteristicsMoss2023]. 
On coastal heathlands, sheep grazing is still locally paired with rotational prescribed burning which has been used by farmers for rejuvenating patches of mature heath and stimulating the growth of young, more palatable *Calluna* stems [@barclay-estrupDescriptionInterpretationCyclical1969; @thorvaldsenGammalnorskSauOg2017]. 
The rotational dynamic, with new patches burnt every year, creates a mosaic-like landscape of different heath regeneration stages [@vandvikManagingHeterogeneityImportance2005], each characterised by distinct micro-environmental conditions [@fonturbelEffectRepeatedPrescribed2021] which alter recolonisation and successional processes [@marenChangingContributionsStochastic2018], enhancing plant and arthropod diversity at both local and regional scales [@bargmannEffectsPrescribedBurning2015; @velleDoesPrescribedBurning2014].

On the more productive semi-natural grasslands, the agricultural transition has generated a socio-economic gradient of farm structures including both full-time, more production-oriented farmers, often but not exclusively associated with mixed dairy-beef systems, and part-time farmers which rather breed sheep or goats, more suitable for smaller, subsidiary activities [@asheimPolicyMeasuresPreserve2020; @potthoffNorwegianLowintensityOvine2023]. 
The grazing impact of cattle, sheep or goats on the structure and composition of the sward is linked to their different foraging strategies [@rookBiteDimensionsGrazing2004], which are determined by an extensive combination of morphological (e.g. mouth parts), biological (e.g. dietary requirements) and social (e.g. group interactions) factors [@animutCograzingSheepGoats2008; @parsonsSpatialHeterogeneityGrazing2003; @rookMatchingTypeLivestock2004]. 
For example, smaller animals such as sheep or goats are more efficient than cattle for reaching less accessible plants and selecting higher quality parts [@gaujourFactorsProcessesAffecting2012; @marrsReleaseSheepGrazing2020], increasing by extent their relative consumption of forbs and proteins [@mohammedGrazingBehaviorDietary2020; @tothLivestockTypeMore2016]. 
This foraging efficiency also leads to a more thorough and even utilisation of the field, while cattle opportunistic behaviour rather increases the structural heterogeneity of the sward [@ravettoenriBiodiversityfriendlyRotationalGrazing2017]. 
On the other hand, cattle size generates another selective pressure through the intensification of trampling disturbance on standing vegetation, deteriorating the bryophyte cover and facilitating the growth of graminoids [@ludvikovaLongTermDefoliation2014]. 
Depending on the strength of the selectivity and trampling processes, a certain degree of complementarity in the delivery of pollination and forage production services could thus be expected between fields grazed by different livestock types [@cutterCattleGrazingResults2022].
Similar processes also influence the soil system functioning, as for instance in cattle-grazed fields higher trampling disturbance would tend to aggravate soil compaction and erosion [@mayelHowDoesGrassland2021; @zhangSoilPhysicalChemical2019] while increased manure deposition and fertilisation would enhance the nutrient supply and support a more abundant dung-associated faunal community [@betancur-corredorOrganicNitrogenFertilization2023; @sigsgaardEnvironmentalDNAMetabarcoding2021].
Finally, direct grazer effects interacts with additional management practices such as field enrichment with manure or artificial fertiliser, whose systematic use in mixed dairy-beef production systems could tend to increase the proportions of nitrophilous grass [@gaujourFactorsProcessesAffecting2012] at the expense of plant diversity, and more particularly bryophyte species richness [@bochDirectIndirectEffects2018; @hejcmanRengenGrasslandExperiment2007; @socherInteractingEffectsFertilization2013].
The impact of domestic grazing on biodiversity and the delivery of ecosystem services in semi-natural grasslands and heathlands thus results from the interaction of multiple factors more or less directly related to the different types of agronomic production, which are expected to complement each others in shaping the agro-ecological landscape of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve [@kremenEcosystemServicesBiologically2012; @sollenbergerGrasslandManagementAffects2019].

### Box 2. The history of traditional farming in Nordhordland {#box-history}
The first signs of agricultural activity in Western Norway can be traced back to the early Neolithic, with the introduction of burning [@hjelleLongtermChangesRegional2018; @prosch-danielsenPalaeoecologicalInvestigationsReconstruction2000] and domestic grazing [@hjelleHesitantHuntersReview2006; @mehlCulturalLandscapeDevelopment2015] which drastically expanded the area of heathland on the coast. 
By the time of middle Neolithic, grazing management had reached the fjord and mountain areas, and by late Neolithic cereal cultivation had also spread in the more fertile, inner regions [@hjelleHesitantHuntersReview2006]. 
The initial hunter-fishers had progressively settled into fisher-farmers (*fiskarbonde*), who still depended on both sea and land resources to ensure their livelihood. 
It is during the Iron Age that the traditional small-scale farming of Western Norway, whose legacy has lasted till the present days, reached its maturity [@olssonAgroecosystemsNeolithicTime1991]. 
To overcome the high discrepancy in land productivity, fisher-farmers relied on a mixed crop-livestock system where low-productive outfields (*utmark*) were grazed and/or mowed and more productive infields (*innmark*) were cultivated, with manure and mulch transferred from the former to the latter for soil enrichment [@austadHumaninfluencedVegetationTypes1991; @indrelidFarmingSystemIts1988]. 
This complementary management shaped the agro-ecological landscape into a fine mosaic of small, pluriactive family farms [@hetlandPluriactivityStrategyEmployment1986; @jonesLandtenureLandscapeChange1988], which would typically encompass a few arable fields, several patches of more or less productive semi-natural grasslands for rotational grazing and/or hay-making and some forested areas for timber and fire wood [@austadHumaninfluencedVegetationTypes1991; @haugeGaldaneLaerdalWestern1988]. 
The heathland areas on the coast and in the mountains were used as outfields only, with year-round grazing combined with rotational prescribed burning for the former [@hjelleLongtermChangesRegional2018; @vandvikManagementdrivenEvolutionDomesticated2014], and sheep and cattle summer transhumance for the latter [@indrelidFarmingSystemIts1988; @potthoffChangeMountainSummer2004]. 
Fisher-farmers therefore made use of the whole coast-to-mountain gradient to create a spatially and temporally dynamic system of energy flows from the outer areas to the inner areas (@fig-succession), durably imprinting the fjord landscape with an unprecedented level of ecological and cultural diversity [@olssonAgroecosystemsNeolithicTime1991].

# Aim of the thesis

This PhD thesis aimed to explore the role of domestic grazers in supporting ecological diversity and ensuring the supply of multiple ecosystem services in the agro-ecological landscape of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, based on two main objectives:
(1) to estimate to which extent the environmental gradient of the fjord system determines the characteristics of the grazing fields and limits land use and agronomic production across different spatial ranges;
(2) to assess the effects of grazing management and complementary practices such as rotational prescribed burning on the diversity, community composition and ecosystem services of semi-natural heathlands and grasslands.
Following the research framework of the TradMod project, which aimed to provide actionable knowledge to support decision-making for sustainable land use in the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, we relied on an explicitly exploratory approach to meet three main conditions: 
(a) to capture the diversity of environments and grazing fields typical to the small-scale grazing systems in the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, by encompassing a large geographical area and a wide range of production systems; 
(b) to take management-oriented perspectives with an emphasis on the benefits provided by the farmer activity, by extensively relying on the ecosystem service framework; 
(c) to provide a comprehensive data baseline to steer future research in the agro-ecological landscape of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, by investigating the responses of multiple taxa and ecological indicators (@tbl-papersummary).

More specifically, we investigated:

- the effect of rotational prescribed burning on beetle diversity and ecological preferences by comparing active assemblages on pioneer and mature heath in a coastal heathland grazed all year round by Old Norse sheep (**paper I**);
- the influence of livestock type (sheep, cattle, goat) and landscape zone (coast, fjord) on the delivery of agronomic services in semi-natural grasslands by using indicators of nectar and forage resource based on plant functional traits (**paper II**);
- the cross-scale interactions affecting the composition of these same semi-natural grasslands by testing correlations between sets of variables characterising fjord climate, landscape composition, grazing management, fine-scale environment and dominant grass, forb and beetle assemblages (**paper III**);
- the ecosystem services trade-offs and synergies provided by different land uses by assessing the aboveground and belowground productivity, the biodiversity and the carbon sequestration potential of grazing fields along the whole coast-to-mountain gradient (**paper IV**).

# Research approach and study design

## Study area

The Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve is an area of 669,800 ha located in the fjord region of Western Norway, encompassing 11 municipalities for a total population of about 55,000 inhabitants [@kalandNordhordlandBiosphereReserve2018]. 
The Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve is delimited by the Bergen and Hardanger regions in the south and the longest and deepest Norwegian fjord, the Sognefjord, in the north (@fig-maptopo A).   
The western border stretches up to approximately 23 km in the North Sea, for a marine surface representing 37% of the total area, and the northeastern border reaches beyond the Stølsheimen mountains, which include the highest relief of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve at 1313 masl. 
On 1,650 farmers declaring their activities in 2019 [@reiersenBaerekraftVestnorskLandbruk2019], around 530 were herding cattle for an average of 25.8 heads per holding, among which about 320 had additional milking cows for an average of 21.1 heads per holding. 
Around 1100 farmers were herding sheep for an average of 41.4 heads per holding, and a bit more than 200 of them were breeding both sheep and cattle. 
Finally, only about 80 farmers were herding goats for an average of 40 heads per holding. 
Farmers declared on average 6.8 ha of productive infields, ranging between 0.1 ha for the smallest field area and 92.3 ha for the biggest field area.

### Ecological survey in the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (paper II, paper III, paper IV)

The study area for paper II, paper III and paper IV was defined as to be representative of both the environmental context and the management practices of the small-scale grazing systems of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, with three main factors determining the distribution of the grazing fields:

  (1) the **west-east environmental gradient**, which we separated into three main regions, i.e. the coastal area, the fjord area and the mountain area, based on the landscape zonation from @uttakleivLandskapskartleggingNorgeLandscape2011.
  (2) the **field productivity**, classified as infields or outfields based on the "areal type" AR5 classification system developed by the Norwegian Institute for Bioeconomy (NIBIO) [@ahlstromAR5Klassifikasjonssystem2019]. Infields (*innmarksbeite*) are "*agricultural lands that cannot be harvested mechanically* \[with\] *at least 50% of the area* \[...\] *covered with cultured grass or pasture-tolerant herbs*", while outfields belong to the "open permanent lands" (*åpen fastmark*) category, briefly defined as "*areas that are neither a bog, agricultural, forest or infrastructure*".
  (3) the **livestock type** as either cattle, sheep or goats, as registered in @reiersenBaerekraftVestnorskLandbruk2019.

Additional criteria of site accessibility were also considered to facilitate field sampling, such as an average travel time of 1h from the University of Bergen (except mountain sites). 
We contacted the farmers prior to the field visit to have their approval for a sampling on their farm, to verify the management information and to collect, when provided, advice on most suitable options for study sites.

In summer 2019 and 2020, we visited a total of 42 grazing fields distributed in the coastal (n = 19), fjord (n = 17) and mountain (n = 6) areas (@fig-sitemap). 
We led the field seasons from mid-June to mid-August, visiting in chronological order coastal sites, fjord sites and mountain sites to account for the timing difference of the spring bloom [@karlsenVariabilityStartGrowing2007]. 
Sites in the coastal and fjord areas were all located below 250 masl and showed relatively similar climate conditions, with an average July temperature close to 14°C and average annual precipitation around 1900 mm (@fig-climatedistri A and E), except for annual temperature range which increased linearly with distance-to-sea (@fig-climatedistri C). 
Mountain sites were located between 600 and 875 masl and were characterised by colder and especially wetter conditions (@fig-climatedistri B and F), with an average July temperature of `r format(round(mean(filter(avgclim, EcoZone == "mountain")$avgtempJuly), 1), nsmall = 1)`°C and half of the sites receiving more than 3500 mm precipitation annually.

#### Outfields (paper IV)

Outfields were sheep-grazed, shrub-dominated communities (n = 12), located in the outer part of the coastal area (n = 5), in a former forest clearing in the fjord area (n = 1) and in the mountain area (n = 6) (@tbl-siterepartition). 

Coastal outfields were Northern Atlantic wet heaths dominated by *Calluna vulgaris* and grazed all year round by the main Norwegian rustic breed, the Norwegian old sheep (*Gammel Norsk Sau*) [@norskinstituttforbiookonominibioSau2025], with an average of 36.8 heads of adult sheep for areas ranging from 30 to 170 ha. 
Three sites have been grazed uninterruptedly by sheep since at least 2000, one site had been grazed by cattle until 2016, and one site had been abandoned for 50 years until 2019. 
Three sites were managed by rotational prescribed burning and one site had invasive Sitka spruce removed.

The single outfield of the fjord region was characterised by a seemingly transitional community, with high covers of *Galium saxatile*, *Vaccinium myrtillus*, *Agrostis capillaris* and *Anthoxanthum odoratum*. 
The field of 20 ha was grazed 4 months a year by 15 adults from the Cheviot breed (*Sjeviotsau*), which has been on site since 1997. 

Mountain outfields were subalpine dwarf heaths with mixed grass-shrub vegetation dominated by *Nardus stricta*, *Vaccinium uliginosum*, *Empetrum nigrum* and *Calluna vulgaris*. 
Sites were grazed by free-ranging sheep from either the conventional Norwegian white sheep (*Norsk Kvit Sau*), the Dala breed (*Dalasau*), which was one of the Norwegian white sheep's parent breed, or the rustic English Suffolk breed (*Suffolksau*), with an average of 57 heads of adult sheep staying on site between 3 and 4 months in the summer season. 
All sites have been grazed uninterruptedly by sheep since at least 2010, the oldest record dating back to the 1940s, and three sites used to be grazed by cattle.

#### Infields (paper II, paper III, paper IV)

Infields were permanent pastures located in the coastal (n = 14) and in the fjord (n = 16) areas (@tbl-siterepartition), dominated by either *Agrostis capillaris*-*Festuca rubra* or *Agrostis capillaris*-*Anthoxanthum odoratum* assemblages, with common occurrences of *Holcus lanatus* and *Poa pratensis*.

Sites grazed by cattle (n = 10) (**paper II**, **paper III**) ranged from 1 to 30 ha for an average of 17.7 heads staying on field between 2 and 8 months. 
The most common dairy cattle breed was the Norwegian Red (*Norsk Rødt Fe*), but sites were also grazed by the Limousin beef cattle, the rustic Highland cattle or the the Aberdeen Angus beef cattle. 
All fields have been grazed uninterruptedly by cattle since at least 2011, with the oldest record dating back to the 1920s, except one which had a 2-year interruption between 2016 and 2018. 
All sites were enriched yearly by artificial fertiliser, supplemented by manure for eight of them, and with an additional shellsand-lime mix for five of them to control soil acidity [@sognnesEffectsAddingMoraine2006]. 
Three farmers also reported to occasionally mulch their fields and only one farmer used herbicides. 
Three fields were resown between the 1940s and the 1970s, among which two were also plowed during the same time period, and three fields were drained between the 1970s and 2000s.

Sites grazed by sheep (n = 11) (**paper II**, **paper III**, **paper IV**)  ranged from 1.3 ha to 19.3 ha for an average of 45 adult heads staying on field from 3 to 12 months. 
The most common breed was the Norwegian old sheep, but fields were also grazed by the Norwegian white sheep, the Cheviot or the rustic Spælsau (*Gammel Norsk Spælsau*). 
All sites were grazed uninterruptedly since at least 2004, with the oldest records dating back to the 1950s, except two which had a 3-years and a 5-years interruptions between 2012 and 2015 and between 2006 and 2011 respectively. 
Six farmers treated their fields with artificial fertilisers and two of them also used manure, while only one farmer used shellsand-lime mix. 
Five sites were mulched at least occasionally, among which one farmer also burnt locally to facilitate the breeding of the Northern lapwing (*Vanellus vanellus*). 
Three fields were resown before the 1970s and three fields were drained in the 1950s, in 2000 and in 2010 respectively.

Finally, sites grazed by goats (n = 9) (**paper II**, **paper III**) ranged from 0.4 to 29.9 ha for an average of 38.7 adult heads staying on field from 2 to 12 months. 
The most common breed was the Cashmere goat (*Kasjmir Geit*), but sites were also grazed by the Norwegian milking goat (*Norsk Melke Geit*). 
All sites have been grazed uninterruptedly by goats since at least 2015, with the oldest records dating back to 2000, and five of them were previously grazed by sheep for various periods stretching from the 1969 to 2014. 
Five farmers enriched their fields with artificial fertiliser, among which one also used manure and another used shellsand-lime mix, and one farmer treated the field with herbicide. 
There was no mention of resowing or plowing in the sites history, and to the farmers' knowledge only one site was drained in the 1920s.

### Beetle assemblages after prescribed burning on coastal heathland (paper I)

The ecological survey for paper I was led on one of our outermost coastal outfield, Hopøyna, in the Øygarden municipality (60°38′N, 4°49′E) (@fig-sitemap). 
The climatic conditions are heavily influenced by the oceanic regime, with an average July temperature of 13.8°C, an average January temperature of 3.0°C and annual precipitation around 1900 mm. 
This 115-hectares peninsula is typical to the most exposed coastal strandflats of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, with a contrasted landscape of highly eroded ridges, essentially dominated by *Calluna vulgaris* stands, and water-saturated depressions characterised by *Molinia caerulea* mires. 
The area used to be grazed by cattle until the 1970s, but was abandoned until 2018 when the current farmer initiated prescribed burning in the northeastern part of the peninsula. He burnt new patches progressing southwards in 2019 (@fig-oymap A), and the same year he brought in 36 heads of Norwegian old sheep for year-round grazing (~0.4 sheep/ha).

## Data collection

### Ecological survey in the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (paper II, paper III, paper IV)

The data collection for **paper II**, **paper III** and **paper IV** was based on a common nested sampling design set in a 400 m^2^ area representative of each grazing field, which avoided at most exposed rocks, waterlogged ground, trees and field edges (@fig-sampling). 
The sampling area was by default 20 m x 20 m (@fig-pic20area), except in two sites where it was set as 40 m x 10 m instead because of limiting topography and field shape, and was delimited by fences to prevent animals from entering. 
We collected on site GPS coordinates, maximum elevation and slope angle between the highest and the lowest point of the sampling area, while slope aspect was obtained from a Digital Elevation Model of 10 m x 10 m cell size from the Norwegian Mapping Authority [@kartverketGeoNorgeKartkatalogen2023] and climate data were 1 km^2^ daily projections for the period 2010-2020 retrieved from the Norwegian Centre for Climate Service [@meteorologiskinstituttNorskKlimaservicesenter2023; @wongGriddedKmClimate2016] (**paper III**). 
Following the same exclusion rules as for the sampling area, we delimited three plots of 3 m x 3 m separated from each other by at least 6 m. Each plot was divided into nine quadrats of 1 m^2^, five allocated to non-destructive sampling and four allocated to destructive sampling (@fig-picplot A). The whole sampling process was designed to be completed within a day for each site.

Non-destructive quadrats (15 replicates per site) (@fig-picplot B) were dedicated to the recording of sward composition and structure by the same two observers (Amy E. Eycott and myself) across both field seasons, including: the identification of all vascular, bryophyte and lycophyte species and the estimation of their percent cover from 0.01 to 100% (**paper II**, **paper III**, **paper IV**); the estimation of the percent cover of bare ground, rock and litter from 0,01 to 100% (**paper III**); the estimation of average sward height by random measurements (**paper III**). 
Species that could not be identified on the field as well as all bryophytes and lycophytes were collected for expert identification.

Destructive quadrats were dedicated to the investigation of plant biomass, beetle assemblage and biotic and abiotic parameters of the soil system. 
Standing biomass (**paper IV**) was collected within one 0.5 m x 0.5 m quadrat per plot (3 replicates per site) (@fig-picplot C) and sorted in the lab into cryptogam, grass, forb and woody vegetation for dry weight measurements. 
We performed two tests of soil resistance to penetration in each quadrat (24 replicates per site) (**paper III**) by dropping a sharpened metal rod of 1.3 kg (length 43.4 cm; diameter 2.2 cm) from 1 m above the ground through a PVC tube to ensure vertical fall (@fig-picquadrat A). 
Soil was also collected with two types of cores in each 1 m^2^ quadrat: three smaller PVC cores of 57.23 cm^3^ (3.7 cm diameter; 10 cm height) (@fig-picquadrat B) were used for the estimation of bulk density and gravimetric water content (36 replicates per site) (**paper III**) and a bigger stainless steel cylindrical core of 200 cm^3^ (diameter 10.5 cm; height 12 cm) (@fig-picquadrat C) was used for either mesofauna sampling (**paper IV**), for one core out of four per plot (3 replicates per site), or chemical analyses for the three remaining soil cores (**paper III**, **paper IV**). 
Mesofauna was extracted with Berlese-Tullgren funnels [@tullgrenSehrEinfacherAusleseapparat1918], stored into 70% ethanol and sorted into Collembola and Acari. 
The soil for chemical analyses was sieved and merged at the plot level (3 replicates per site) for a subsample of 0.5 L to be sent to a certified analysis laboratory for the determination of loss of ignition (LOI) [@schulteEstimationSoilOrganic1996], total nitrogen content with modified Kjeldahl method (NS-EN13654-1:2890) [@bremnerDeterminationNitrogenSoil1960] and available phosphorus concentration with ammonium lactate extraction method [@brayDeterminationTotalOrganic1945]. 
We finally set dung-baited pitfall traps (diameter 10.5 cm; height 11.5 cm) (**paper III**) in the holes left by the stainless steel core to collect ground-dwelling beetles for a full week (12 replicates per site) (@fig-picquadrat D). 
Specimens were sorted at the family level using @duffBeetlesBritainIreland2012a and stored in 70% ethanol.

### Beetle assemblages after prescribed burning on coastal heathland (paper I)

In summer 2020, we collected ground-dwelling beetles on five replicates of pioneer heath in the recently burnt area and five replicates of mature heath in the southern area (@fig-oymap B) for two sampling rounds of 15 days each between mid-June and early August. 
The sampling design was elaborated to fit the narrow shape of the burnt patches, which were mostly restricted to the ridges. 
On each replicate, we placed four octagonal sets of pitfall traps 10 m from each other along a 40 m transect following the direction of the slope, for a total of 32 pitfall traps. 
Traps were plastic cups of 6.5 cm diameter (250 mL) set 1 m apart from each other and covered with a metal roof in the exposed burnt area to prevent overflowing (@fig-oymap C). 
Beetles were collected every week and stored in 70% ethanol after sorting at the species level. 
We used the Fauna Entomologica Scandinavica series [@lindrothCarabidaeColeopteraFennoscandia1985; @lindrothCarabidaeColeopteraFennoscandia1986] for the identification of Carabidae, the Swedish Insect fauna (*Svensk Insektfauna*) series [@palmSkalbaggarColeopteraKortvingar1961; @palmSkalbaggarColeopteraKortvingar1963; @palmSkalbaggarColeopteraKortvingar1966; @palmSkalbaggarColeopteraKortvingar1968; @palmSkalbaggarColeopteraKortvingar1972] for Staphylinidae, and the Beetles of Britain and Ireland series [@duffBeetlesBritainIreland2012a; @duffBeetlesBritainIreland2012; @duffBeetlesBritainIreland2020] for all other families. 
Staphylinidae were identified by John Skartveit, who also verified the identification of all other species and provided very valuable expert knowledge (see Acknowledgements in **paper I**). 
Morphological traits (body size, wing presence) and ecological preferences in relation to moisture and ground cover were collected from the same taxonomic references.

### Farmer interviews

Between October 2021 and January 2022, we conducted phone interviews with the farmers to collect detailed information on the livestock and the field management, including: the livestock breed; the number of adult and young animals (**paper III**); the surface area of the field we visited (**paper III**); the yearly occupation of the field by livestock (**paper III**); the grazing history including current and former livestock as well as past land use; the type, frequency and intensity of additional management such as fertilisation, mulching, burning... 
For the 6 out of the 39 farmers who were unable or unwilling to reply to the questionnaire, we referred to the data from @reiersenBaerekraftVestnorskLandbruk2019, which was not site-specific but still allowed to collect general information on livestock type and flock size, and we also relied on the open data from the agricultural properties mapping service (*Gårdskart*) of the Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy [@norskinstituttforbiookonominibioGardskart2023] to retrieve, when available, the field surface area (**paper III**). 
Due to incomplete and/or approximate information due to missing respondents and different levels of farmer knowledge especially regarding additional management (e.g. fertiliser amount or frequency), these data were, for most part, unfortunately not fitted to be included in the statistical analyses. 
On the other hand they proved very valuable for providing more concrete, site-dependent context to the ecological study, and also allowed us to verify the circumstances of odd values when necessary (e.g. Acari abundance in infields in **paper IV**).

## Analytical approaches

Considering the limited site replication (42 sites in total) and the inherently high variability associated with both the geophysical context and the grazing management, we took an explicit exploratory approach and favoured robustness over sensitivity for statistical tests. 
All analyses were performed on R versions 4.1.1 (**paper II**), 4.1.3 (**paper I**) and 4.4.1 (**paper III**, **paper IV**) [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2024] with R studio versions 1.4.1717 (**paper I**) and 2023.04.2 (**paper III**, **paper IV**) [@positteamRStudioIntegratedDevelopment2024].
Unless otherwise indicated, we usually relied on the *vegan* package [@oksanenVeganCommunityEcology2024] versions 2.6-2 (**paper I**), 2.6-4 (**paper II**) and 2.6-8 (**paper III**) for ordination analyses and used the *ggplot2* package [@wickhamGgplot2CreateElegant2024] versions 3.3.5 (**paper I**), 3.4.0 (**paper II**) and 3.5.1 (**paper III**, **paper IV**) for visual representation.

### Beetle assemblages after prescribed burning on coastal heathland (paper I)

In **paper I**, we aimed to contribute to the quite extensive research pool on prescribed burning in Western Norway, which has mostly focused on plant [e.g. @marenPrescribedBurningNorthern2010; @marenChangingContributionsStochastic2018; @vandvikManagingHeterogeneityImportance2005; @vandvikManagementdrivenEvolutionDomesticated2014; @velleDoesPrescribedBurning2014] but also on ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) [e.g. @bargmannEffectsPrescribedBurning2015; @bargmannSpeciesTraitSelection2016], by investigating the whole beetle (Coleoptera) activity after recent fires in a coastal heathland. 
We compared the diversity, composition and ecological preferences between beetle assemblages collected on pioneer heath patches, one to two years after fire, and on mature heath patches, undisturbed for several decades. 
Statistical analyses were based on beetle species count data, pooled at the replicate level (n = 10). 
We tested the differences in species richness, Shannon diversity (H) and Simpson's evenness (E~1/D~) [@smithConsumerGuideEvenness1996] with non-parametric Wilcoxon tests.
Beta-diversity was estimated as the group dispersion between patches of the same heath stage based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity [@schroederHowRobustAre2018] and was compared between heath stages with an ANOVA. 
We analysed the community composition according to the date of fire (undisturbed; 2-years post-burn; 1-year post-burn) using Constrained Correspondance Analysis (CCA) with ANOVA permutation test, and we identified indicator species for pioneer and mature heaths relying on both the phi's coefficient of correlation [@sokalBiometryPrinciplesPractice2012] and the IndVal index [@dufreneSpeciesAssemblagesIndicator1997], calculated with the *indicspecies* package from @decaceresIndicspeciesRelationshipSpecies2022. 
Finally, we compared the distributions of the community weighted means of body size, the wing morphology and the moisture and vegetation cover preferences between assemblages from pioneer and mature heaths using Fisher t-tests.

### Ecosystem services in semi-natural grasslands grazed by different livestock types (paper II)

In **paper II**, we aimed to investigate how environmental variation and grazing management in the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve affect the delivery of ecosystem services in semi-natural grasslands, which in Western Norway has mostly been studied in relation with land abandonment only [e.g. @johansenCeasedGrazingManagement2019; @wehnRelationshipsBiodiversityEcosystem2018]. 
We compared plant diversity, functional group composition, and nectar and forage resource values of 30 permanent grasslands according to landscape zone (coastal, fjord) and livestock type (cattle, sheep, goats), expecting trade-offs according to the productivity gradient and the feeding preferences of the grazers.
Statistical analyses were based on plant species cover-abundance data, pooled at the plot level (n = 60).
The nectar resource indicator was based on the annual nectar productivity per unit cover from @baudeHistoricalNectarAssessment2016 and ranked from 0 to 4 using @melinBotaniqueApicoleApicultural2011, while the forage resource indicator was collected from the e-flora-sys database [@plantureuxEFLORAsysWebsiteTool2010] and scaled from 0 to 3 according to functional type. 
We used linear mixed-effects models with the *lme4* package [@batesFittingLinearMixedEffects2015] to test the independent and interacting effects of landscape zone and livestock type on vascular plant species richness, nectar and forage values and on the scores of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of plant functional groups, with the year of sampling and the observer as confounding factors. 
We analysed synergies and trade-offs by testing correlations between vascular plant species richness, nectar indicator value and forage indicator value with either Kendall non-parametric correlation (richness x nectar), Pearson linear correlation (richness x forage) or Spearman rank non-parametric correlation (nectar x forage). 
We finally relied on Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Problems [@yoonMultipleAttributeDecision1995] using the *topsis* package from @yazdiTopsisTOPSISMethod2013 to rank our sites according to their level of within-field synergy between plant species richness, forage resource indicator and nectar resource indicator.

### Cross-scale interactions in the small-scale grazing system of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (paper III)

**Paper III** was our modest attempt at disentangling the environmental and management-dependent processes affecting the composition of semi-natural grasslands based on a simplified, spatially-explicit conceptual model of the agro-ecological system of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. 
We tested (1) correlations between sets of factors characterising the regional-scale environmental gradient, including climate [@meteorologiskinstituttNorskKlimaservicesenter2023; @wongGriddedKmClimate2016], elevation and geography [@kartverketGeoNorgeKartkatalogen2023], the landscape composition around the fields, based on land cover data from @norskinstituttforbiookonominibioKildenArealinformasjon2023, the grazing management on the field, based on the information collected from the farmer interviews, and the fine-scale environment of the field, including topography, sward structure and edaphic parameters, and (2) correlations between these explanatory sets and the dominant assemblages of grass and forb species and beetle families, based on plant cover-abundance data and beetle count data.
Explanatory sets were based on quantitative variables (except livestock type), pooled at the site level when necessary (n = 29) and verified for odd distributions and strong colinearity. 
Response assemblages were based on plant species cover-abundance data and beetle count data, all pooled at the site level (n = 29) and scaled with Hellinger transformation [@borcardNumericalEcology2011].
We performed preliminary canonical correlation analyses between all sets using the *CCA* package [@gonzalezCCACanonicalCorrelation2023] and we tested the significance of the correlation coefficients with the asymptotic approximation of Hotelling-Lawley trace from the *CCP* package [@menzelCCPSignificanceTests2022]. 
Significant canonical correlations were further analysed with Redundancy Analyses (RDA) [@legendreNumericalEcology2012] tested with ANOVA permutation [@legendreTestingSignificanceCanonical2011] to identify the variables with the highest explanatory power among sets.

### Ecosystem service trade-offs and synergies across the west-east gradient of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (paper IV)

In **paper IV**, we aimed to investigate the delivery of ecosystem services according to a gradient of habitat productivity encompassing semi-natural grasslands, coastal heathlands and subalpine heathlands, which have so far only been investigated independently in Western Norway [e.g. @austrheimSynergiesTradeoffsEcosystem2016; @johansenCeasedGrazingManagement2019].
We compared the contribution of 23 sheep-grazed fields to indicators of diversity, productivity and carbon storage and investigated for synergies and trade-offs associated with field type (infield/outfield) and/or geographical location (coastal/fjord/mountain).
Statistical analyses were based on plant species cover-abundance, aboveground biomass dry weight, Collembola and Acari count data and loss of ignition, scaled and pooled at the site level (n = 23).
We used Ward's hierarchical agglomerative clustering based on Euclidean distance matrix to assess how grazing fields would aggregate according to their contribution to plant species richness, aboveground biomass, mesofauna density and carbon content, compared with the expected distribution according to field type classification (infield/outfield) and geographical area (coastal/fjord/mountain) [@murtaghWardHierarchicalAgglomerative2014].
We investigated synergies an trade-offs between ecological indicators first independently from the clustering with Spearman's rank tests [@hollanderNonparametricStatisticalMethods2015], and second between clusters with unpaired Mann-Whitney tests [@lehmannNonparametricsStatisticalMethods2006] and associated effect size calculated from the Glass rank biserial correlation coefficient [@kingStatisticalReasoningBehavioral2018].

# Main findings

## Range-dependent influence of the west-east environmental gradient of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve

**(1) The hump-shaped productivity pattern determines dominant land use types at regional-scale (paper IV)...** - Field type (infield/outfield) was the main factor of aggregation of grazing fields independently of geographical area, confirming the weathering effect on soil nutrient supply as the primary limitation to livestock production in the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. 
As expected, this dichotomy was partly explained by the distribution of plant functional groups with a negative correlation between forb and shrub biomass, higher in infields and outfields respectively [@diazGlobalSpectrumPlant2016; @winnerResponsePlantsMultiple1991]. 
We also observed additive effects of temperature in the subalpine area, where outfields showed on average four times less shrub biomass and three times less cryptogam biomass compared with the coastal ones [@huangAirTemperatureOptima2019]. 
Farmers adapted their management practices accordingly, with complementary prescribed burning on the coast to control the growth of *Calluna* stands into less palatable, degenerated stages [@barclay-estrupDescriptionInterpretationCyclical1969; @thorvaldsenGammalnorskSauOg2017], while in the mountains livestock pressure is limited in both time and space to account for the slower regenerative ability [@austrheimSynergiesTradeoffsEcosystem2016] (see Discussion in **paper IV**).
On the other hand though, both Acari and Collembola densities, which were expected to also follow a hump-shaped pattern reflecting soil fertility across the west-east gradient, remained unaffected by the environmental stress. 
In @georgeEvaluationMesofaunaCommunities2017, who investigated a wider panel of habitat types ranging from crops to forests, a hump-shaped pattern of total mesofauna abundance was indeed observed but there was no difference between grasslands and heaths particularly, except for oribatid mites [see also @arnottUplandGrasslandHabitats2021]. 
The lack of mesofauna response in our study may thus rather be due to an unsuitable taxonomic resolution for the productivity range of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (see Discussion in **paper IV**). 
Ultimately, the agronomic exploitation of the remote areas is still highly constrained by the environmental gradient, which has ensured the continuity of low-intensive, versatile management practices preserving both the cultural heritage and ecological diversity of the agro-ecological landscape of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve [@indrelidFarmingSystemIts1988; @lillehammerPresentLandscapePerception2007].

**(2) ... but its influence within higher productivity ranges seems mostly outweighed by local conditions (paper II, paper III, paper IV)** - There was an increase of the proportions of infield area and cultivated land area under wetter conditions (**paper III**), but we found no clear evidence of independent effects of the landscape zone (**paper II**, **paper IV**) or climate factors (**paper III**) at the field scale. 
In **paper II**, coastal sites were associated with a higher cover of Poaceae (@fig-fjordR2 B) but only due to an interaction with livestock type, while in **paper III** the significant canonical correlations between regional-scale factors and dominant grass and beetle assemblages were contradicted by the corresponding RDA models.
The frequency of dominant grass and forb species were however consistently correlated with the biophysical characteristics of the infields, with a dominant gradient seemingly opposing on one hand well-drained slopes characterised by higher bryophyte cover, and on the other flatter, more fertile areas showing higher average sward height (**paper III**) [@grimeCompetitiveExclusionHerbaceous1973; @losvikHayMeadowCommunities1993; @vanderwalMossesStruggleLight2005]. 
The primacy of local variables over regional processes in the most productive area of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve was predictable, considering both the limited spatial extent [@fieldSpatialSpeciesrichnessGradients2009; @siefertScaleDependenceVegetationenvironment2012] (see Discussion in **paper III**) and the reduced level of abiotic stress [@fraserWorldwideEvidenceUnimodal2015; @hunterMorphologicalPhysiologicalResponse2005] (see Discussion in **paper II**).
In comparison, ecological studies actually reporting a change in grassland diversity or species distribution usually rely on broader areas [e.g. @baldiEffectsGrazingBiogeographic2013 or @raatikainenImpactsLocalRegional2007] and/or include stronger environmental gradients [e.g. @zelnikPlantSpeciesDiversity2013].
In an extensive study on meadow communities though, @losvikHayMeadowCommunities1993 did highlight a divergence in species composition between coastal and boreal meadows along with a seemingly concurring fertilisation gradient, suggesting that grasslands further inland were, at the time, more productive and more intensively managed.
A more thorough analysis of plant community is thus necessary before concluding on the negligible effects of the west-east gradient on the diversity and composition of the semi-natural grasslands in the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, which, if confirmed, could result from the generalised intensification of grazing management over time [@kiddImpacts120Years2017] (see Discussion in **paper IV**).

## The effects of domestic grazing on the NBR semi-natural grasslands and heathlands

**(1) Domestic grazing promotes ecosystem service synergies across the whole agro-ecological landscape of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (paper II, paper IV)...** - Regardless of the management or the production system, the grazing fields were characterised by high plant diversity (@fig-grazingR1 A) [@hamrePlantSpeciesRichness2010] and supported the delivery of multiple ecosystem services (**paper II**, **paper IV**) [@kremenEcosystemServicesBiologically2012]. 
Outfields were the most heterogeneous and species-rich habitats, with a lower carrying capacity compensated by higher contribution to carbon storage and water regulation services (**paper IV**) [@huStructuralCharacteristicsMoss2023; @quinCallunaVulgarisdominatedUpland2015]. 
In infields, nectar resource indicator and forage resource indicator were positively correlated (@fig-grazingR1 B), but only the former significantly increased with vascular plant species richness (**paper II**) [@heglandRelationshipsDensityDiversity2006]. 
Most studies investigating the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem service delivery in agro-ecosystems converge to acknowledge the evidence of a virtuous cascade under low-intensity farming, where higher diversity levels support a wider range of ecosystem services [@leprovostSupplyMultipleEcosystem2022; @schilsPermanentGrasslandsEurope2022; @wragePhytodiversityTemperatePermanent2011]. 
The pollination service shows a quite intuitive example of direct positive effects of plant taxonomic and functional richness on the amount, stability and plurality of pollinator food resource, resulting in a more active, more abundant and more diverse community of pollinators [@balfourTradeoffPollinatorwildflowerDiversity2025; @goulnikFloralTraitFunctional2020; @heglandRelationshipsDensityDiversity2006]. 
An exception to these generally synergetic interactions is the complex relationship between biodiversity and provisioning services [@leprovostSupplyMultipleEcosystem2022]: while plant diversity enhances forage nutritional quality [@jerrentrupDiverseSwardsMixedgrazing2020; @seitherSwardCompositionGrazer2012; @spehnEcosystemEffectsBiodiversity2005], increasing both species richness and forage production can only be compatible up to a certain threshold of management intensity beyond which competition and grazing pressure increase the dominance of fewer species [@brunProductivitybiodiversityRelationshipVaries2019; @schulzTradeoffsGrasslandPlant2024]. 
For nectar and forage resources to be positively correlated in the infields of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, it could be assumed that the current grazing management maintains the biodiversity-productivity balance in a tight win-win space independently of the type of agronomic production [@balfourTradeoffPollinatorwildflowerDiversity2025; @gongBiodiversityYieldTradeoffs2022; @ravettoenriBiodiversityfriendlyRotationalGrazing2017] (see Discussion in **paper II**). 
At the same time though, the lower performance of semi-natural grasslands into other regulating services compared with coastal and subalpine heathlands highlights that at least a certain extent of trade-offs is inherent to single agricultural habitats, and as such ensuring the multifunctionality of agro-ecological systems requires to rely on multiple, complementary land uses [@kremenLandscapesThatWork2018] (see Discussion in **paper IV**).

**(2) ...while rotational prescribed burning locally enhances functional diversity and contributes to the regional heterogeneity of coastal heathlands (paper I, paper IV)...** - The Hopøyna beetle community showed different activity on pioneer and mature heath patches according to the species' preferences in moisture and vegetation cover (**paper I**): recently burnt patches were characterised by higher proportions of xerophilous and sun-loving species, while mature patches showed higher proportions of strict hygrophilous species [@morettiFireinducedTaxonomicFunctional2010; @schirmelResponseCarabidBeetles2011]. 
Fire reduced patch alpha diversity but without significantly increasing beta-diversity, contrary to previous findings [@bargmannEffectsPrescribedBurning2015; @brunbjergDisturbanceDryCoastal2015]. 
At the regional level though, coastal heathlands showed the highest between-site divergence compared with subalpine heathlands and grasslands (**paper IV**), suggesting that management by prescribed burning on three sites out of five rather tends to increase ecosystem heterogeneity [@velleDoesPrescribedBurning2014]. 
Atlantic heathlands are particularly vulnerable habitats as they depend on low-intensive, small-scale production systems which do not ensure the economic viability of the farms in the current globalised, highly competitive agricultural context [@hernandez-morcilloPriorityQuestionsScience2017]. 
Norwegian farmers generally show willingness in preserving the cultural landscape but there are practical limitations to maintain the management on remote areas [@forbordDriversChangeNorwegian2014; @kvakkestadNorwegianFarmersPerspectives2015], and even more so regarding the practice of prescribed burning which requires specific skills and dedicated training as the legacy from previous generation has mostly disappeared over time [@lundbergAustevollChangingCoastal1991].
Public support is usually motivated by the conservation interest of semi-natural heathlands as red-listed habitats [@hovstadKystlyngheiSeminaturligNorsk2018], but there are still considerable knowledge gaps regarding the effect of fire on arthropod taxa especially, despite their strong potential as bioindicators (see Discussion in **paper I**) [@rittlTraditionalNorwegianFarming2025; @yekwayoOnlyMultitaxonStudies2018], and on the delivery of ecosystem services, such as for instance carbon sequestration [@kopittkeAgeManagedHeathland2013; @liLongtermTemporalPatterns2023] (see Discussion in **paper IV**), that will be critical to address for ensuring the continuity of traditional prescribed burning on coastal areas [@walmsleyEnsuringLongtermProvision2021].

**(3) ...but the independent effects of livestock type and field management on the structure and composition of semi-natural grasslands are either marginal or yet to be clearly identified (paper II, paper III).** - We observed higher cover of Poaceae under cattle grazing (**paper II**) (@fig-grazingR3S C) and seemingly higher cover of cryptogams under sheep grazing (**paper II**, **paper III**) (@fig-grazingR3S B), but contrary to expectations there was no sign of grazer selectivity on forb cover (**paper II**) (@fig-grazingR3S D) [@tothLivestockTypeMore2016].
Results from **paper III** were particularly inconclusive as none of the outcomes from the canonical correlation analyses and redundancy analyses were consistent with each other regarding the effect of grazing management on dominant assemblages or fine-scale environment.
The impact of domestic grazing on grassland communities is particularly challenging to assess in observational studies as it results from the interaction of multiple and potentially contradicting mechanisms [@wragePhytodiversityTemperatePermanent2011], which can be alleviated or accentuated by the management intensity (e.g. fertilisation) [@sollenbergerGrasslandManagementAffects2019] and the local environment (e.g. topography, water availability) [@hesterForagingBehaviourSheep1999].
In the small-scale grazing systems of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, both the low intensity of the grazing pressure and the versatility of the rotational management amplify context-dependency and variability between sites [@aldayEffectsLongtermRemoval2021; @bohnStrengthsKSelectionShape2014; @conradiResourceAvailabilityDetermines2017] (see Discussion in **paper III**), thus blurring the partition of variance between independent interactions such as grazer selectivity [@cuchillohilarioForageSelectivityCattle2018; @pakemanLongTermImpacts2019].
As such, the lower bryophyte/graminoid ratio observed in cattle-grazed fields could be explained by either an increase in trampling pressure [@ludvikovaLongTermDefoliation2014] or a more intensive use of artificial fertiliser [@kiddImpacts120Years2017], but we found no supporting correlations with bulk density or nutrient concentration to support any of these hypotheses (**paper III**).
Instead, as the composition of the dominant plant assemblages was primarily affected by the inherent productivity of the sites (**paper III**) [@losvikHayMeadowCommunities1993], these differences may indirectly reflect the farmer decision-making in allocating livestock type according to the agronomic potential of the fields (see Discussion in **paper II**).
Overall, we could not identify the specific drivers of biodiversity and ecosystem service delivery in the semi-natural grasslands of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, which is to be imputed at least partially to the limitations of our study design.
We thus recommend a more thorough analysis of plant and especially arthropod communities [@losvikHayMeadowCommunities1993; @lyonsImpactsContrastingConservation2017], but under the condition of revising the methodological framework to adapt both the local environmental context and the rotational management dynamics [@germanRelationshipsMultipleAspects2017; @sinclairOptionsContextApproach2019].

# Methodological considerations and perspectives

## Heterogeneity and spatio-temporal variability in the Nordhordland agro-ecological system

The small-scale grazing systems of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve result from mutual interactions between a strong environmental context, characterised by complex cross-scale processes between the overlapping oceanity and elevation gradients and multiple levels of topographical heterogeneity [@graaeStayGoHow2018; @zhangDisentanglingEffectsClimate2024], and the grazing animal, as the most direct combination of mechanistic pressures from the bite level of individuals to the whole field occupation by the flock [@parsonsSpatialHeterogeneityGrazing2003], mediated across space and time by the farmer which aims to maintain the socioeconomic performance and sustainability of the farm [@mcginlayThreatAbandonmentSocioecological2017].
Even if predictable to some extent, these interactions still involve a high level of stochasticity stemming not only from the environmental variation but also from the farmer and livestock decision-making, which does not rely on an absolute rationalisation of resource exploitation [@nuthallIntuitiveWorldFarmers2012; @rookMatchingTypeLivestock2004].
An example of successive and co-dependent interactions between the environment, the field, the farmer and the livestock within the small-scale grazing systems of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve could be as follow:

(a) The climate and landform determine patterns of habitat productivity at regional scales, limiting land use and the exploitation of forage resources [@fridleyLongerGrowingSeasons2016; @huangAirTemperatureOptima2019];
(b) According to these environmental conditions as well as socioeconomic criteria including land ownership, farm structure and agronomic production, the farmer frames the intensity (e.g. flock size) and spatio-temporal dynamics (e.g. field area, occupation period) of the grazing pressure across fields [@hylandFactorsInfluencingDairy2018; @robertProcessesAdaptationFarm2016];
(c) Within the field unit, the topography and the farmer management (e.g. fertilisation, prescribed burning) determine nutrient availability and biomass production [@maestreAmountPatternGrassland2007], which in turns affect the livestock movement and foraging strategies [@hesterForagingBehaviourSheep1999; @wallisdevriesImportanceScalePatchiness1999];
(d) The grazing process initiates an energy cycle between the livestock, which removes biomass and redistributes nutrients through urine and dung, and the field, whose recovery potential depends from the resource availability (nutrients, water) and the intensity of the disturbance (foraging, trampling) [@mayelHowDoesGrassland2021; @sittersImpactsBrowsingGrazing2019];
(e) From the field capacity to respond to the grazing pressure over time, the farmer interferes on the grazer x field interaction by adapting the grazing pressure (e.g. flock size, field area) or the nutrient supply (e.g. fertilisation) [@nuthallIntuitiveWorldFarmers2012; @robertProcessesAdaptationFarm2016];
(f) The versatility of the management and the movement of livestock across multiple grazing fields drives a subtle but continuous renewal of the landscape mosaic over the years [@parsonsSpatialHeterogeneityGrazing2003].

This complex multi-interactivity generates particularly high levels of both inherent and induced variability, which were not explicitly accounted for in our choices of study design and analyses and were therefore only poorly addressed in the different papers.
First, we essentially approached the environmental context of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve as a broad and unidirectional west-east gradient while overlooking the multiple levels of spatial heterogeneity induced by the diversity of fjord shape, direction, width and steepness [@bennieInfluenceSlopeAspect2006; @graaeStayGoHow2018; @steinEnvironmentalHeterogeneityUniversal2014].
In **paper III** especially, it would have been relevant to include at least one measure of topographic complexity (e.g. variance of elevation or slope, see @yuMultiscaleComparisonTopographic2015) in the regional-scale explanatory set, which only included site elevation as a landform-related variable.
Second, despite the nested sampling design of our ecological study we did not attempt to investigate grazing management according to the sward patchiness driven by livestock foraging [@tonnGrazingInducedPatchiness2019].
In **paper II ** for instance we could have compared the within-field variation of forage and nectar resource values according to grazer types [@duquetteSpatiallyDiscreteDisturbance2022], or in **paper III** we could have assessed the explanatory power of sward heterogeneity in the fine-scale environment set in relation to grazing management or plant and beetle assemblages [@ravettoenriBiodiversityfriendlyRotationalGrazing2017]. 
Third, the versatility of the rotational management, particularly showing through the inconsistency of occupation time and flock size across the season, caused practical challenges for quantifying individual factors such as stocking density at the field level (see Discussion in **paper III**).
This led us to question not only the accuracy but also the relevance of such field-level assessments which can only poorly capture the spatio-temporal dynamics driven by the rotations and the associated mosaic effect, similarly to how the response of beetles to fire at the patch level in **paper I** may not be representative of the effect of rotational prescribed burning on the beetle community (see Discussion in **paper I**) [@tammeEnvironmentalHeterogeneitySpecies2010; @steinEnvironmentalHeterogeneityUniversal2014].
Lastly, higher indicator sensitivity may have been necessary to capture community responses to grazing management under low disturbance regime, especially for arthropod taxa which were investigated at the rather coarse taxonomic resolution, respectively family-level for beetles in **paper III** and order-level for mesofauna in **paper IV** [@daoudiCompositionPhenologyBeetle2022].
We should have anticipated the considerable level of time, resource and expertise for detailed morphological identification and could have envisioned other approaches during the project planning, such as for instance setting a collaboration with experts or rely on novel DNA methods [@geisenMethodologicalFrameworkEmbrace2019; @sigsgaardEnvironmentalDNAMetabarcoding2021].

## Optimising the study design towards trans-disciplinary farm-level assessments of multifunctionality

Ultimately, ecological research has a role in ensuring the productivity, functionality and resilience of agricultural habitats on the long-term by providing actionable knowledge and concrete perspectives for the implementation and the preservation of sustainable management practices [@altieriLinkingEcologistsTraditional2004; @gardnerAgriculturalResiliencePerspectives2019].
However, for this knowledge to be representative, comprehensive and applicable in consideration of the local context and the involved stakeholders, research standards should be revised to aim for holistic approaches based on robust, spatially-explicit but also flexible methodological frameworks, favouring resolution over replication and providing analytical guidelines rather than ready-made indicators [@germanRelationshipsMultipleAspects2017; @sinclairOptionsContextApproach2019; @wittmanSocialEcologicalPerspective2017].
Concretely, addressing the inherent variance in small-scale grazing systems not as a bias to control but as the most determinant factor [@sinclairOptionsContextApproach2019] requires to shift the focus of the analysis towards the core unit structuring the agro-ecological system, namely the farm [@cloughFieldSizesFuture2020; @deffontainesAgriculturalSystemsLandscape1995; @wilsonWeakStrongMultifunctionality2008].
This choice implies to take a landscape perspective [@leprovostContrastingResponsesBelowground2021; @leprovostSupplyMultipleEcosystem2022; @tscharntkeLandscapePerspectivesAgricultural2005], in which spatial arrangement and connectivity materialise not only as tangible, ecological patches and corridors [@baileyInfluenceThematicResolution2007; @evjuSpatialConfigurationMatters2016] but also as energy and disturbance flows driven by the decision-making of the farmer [@deffontainesAgriculturalSystemsLandscape1995].
With complex interactions involved between the different agro-ecological structures (e.g. rural community, farm, field, paddock), the consideration of multiple spatial scales is however crucial to identify the key processes driving variance in agro-ecological systems [@nashDiscontinuitiesCrossScale2014; @petersCrossScaleInteractions2007], and by extent disentangling the respective influences of the environmental gradient and the management [e.g. @wittmanSocialEcologicalPerspective2017; @redlichDisentanglingEffectsClimate2022].
The determination of suitable indicators will require a more thorough investigation of grassland and heathland communities, as optimal surrogates of biodiversity response to grazing management have yet to be determined [@bucherBiodiversityLowintensityPastures2016; @neffCrossscaleEffectsLand2019].
Priority should be given to taxa contributing to key ecosystem functions [@balSelectingIndicatorSpecies2018], but we advise caution for selecting target groups based on fuzzy definition, such as for instance "dung beetle", unless their dominance in the local context has been confirmed (see Discussion in **paper III**).
We particularly recommend to dedicate more attention to the soil compartment, as scientific evidence on the crucial implication of soil organisms for multifunctionality accumulates while highlighting that considerable knowledge gaps still remain [@bardgettBelowgroundBiodiversityEcosystem2014; @degraaffEffectsAgriculturalIntensification2019; @wangDiversifyingLivestockPromotes2019].

Last but not least, ensuring the pertinence, applicability and accessibility of ecological research in agricultural systems requires the active involvement of the farmers as knowledge-holders, decision-makers and managers through processes of co-production [@bennettLinkingBiodiversityEcosystem2015; @jagerPathwaysImplementationEvidence2020; @rockstromSustainableIntensificationAgriculture2017].
Trans-disciplinary research is still a vast field to explore [@lacombeDesigningAgroecologicalFarming2018], but several principles should be respected to ensure inclusive, open, transparent and equitable collaboration on the long-term [@stringerUnpackingParticipationAdaptive2006].
First, farmer knowledge built from empirical, context-specific and community-based learning, by essence complementary to the fundamental, generalised and discipline-based academic knowledge of scientists, is indispensable for a comprehensive understanding of land use patterns in the agro-ecological system [@altieriLinkingEcologistsTraditional2004; @nuthallIntuitiveWorldFarmers2012; @shiSocialInteractionEffect2021].
We ourselves directly witnessed the considerable capacity of the farmers, and more particularly the elders, to recollect quite precisely the management history of not only their own fields but also the surrounding agricultural landscape, up to 100 years in the past [@ianniRevitalizingTraditionalEcological2015].
Second, research concepts should be discussed, adapted and validated over a common understanding between farmers and scientists [@dickStakeholdersPerspectivesOperationalisation2018; @dramstadIntegratingLandscapebasedValues2001], with priority given to the ones already mostly assimilated in policy-making such as landscape multifunctionality [@bjorkhaugMultifunctionalAgriculturePolicy2008; @kremenLandscapesThatWork2018].
For instance @lamarqueHowEcosystemServices2014 showed that even though farmers were familiar with the concept of ecosystem services and were able to integrate them in their decision-making, they still gained from raised awareness on the least known regulating services (i.e. nitrogen leaching, carbon storage).
Lastly, farmer values should be thoroughly identified and discriminated to reflect the disparity of circumstances within the rural community [@bernuesSeeingNorthernEuropean2016; @busckFarmersLandscapeDecisions2002].
The pragmatic approach of farmers driven by the material consideration of the farm management as well as constraints of socio-economic performance is essential for a realistic feasibility assessment of potential agro-ecological pathways [@wehnAdaptiveBiodiversityManagement2018].

## Perspectives for the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve

We confirmed that biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service delivery in the small-scale grazing systems of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve depended from the continuous management of semi-natural grasslands and heathlands across the whole west-east gradient [@hamrePlantSpeciesRichness2010; @johansenCeasedGrazingManagement2019; @velleDoesPrescribedBurning2014].
Current stakes in Western Norway are thus to ensure the viability of farming, especially in remote areas, and supporting the diversity of farm models [@daugstadAgricultureUpholderCultural2006; @potthoffNorwegianLowintensityOvine2023], by upgrading public subsidies schemes or adding value to the production of commodities associated with cultural heritage such as rustic breeds (e.g. *Gammel Norsk Sau*) or traditional goat summer farms [@asheimPolicyMeasuresPreserve2020; @kvakkestadNorwegianFarmersPerspectives2015].
In this context, the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve has a key role for initiating and mediating knowledge co-production between farmers, scientists and policy-makers for the experimentation of innovative pathways towards multifunctional and resilient food production systems [@jagerPathwaysImplementationEvidence2020; @lacombeDesigningAgroecologicalFarming2018].
If our ecological study assumed a relatively standard, non-participatory research framework, we still aimed to bring a modest contribution to the development of trust and mutual understanding between farmers and scientists: as a token of gratitude for granting access and sharing their knowledge, we delivered a personalised pamphlet to each farmer summarising the biological and environmental data collected on their fields.
In parallel, we produced a generalised version of the pamphlet based on the whole dataset for advertising research achievements with the Biosphere Reserve framework to raise interest and awareness among the general public and potential partners.
With the TradMod project as the first stepping stone [see @cusensParticipatoryMappingReveals2022; @cusensIntegrationMattersCombining2023], the team associated with the UNESCO Chair on Sustainable Heritage and Environmental Management strives to take the lead in trans-disciplinary research for maximising the potential of the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve as a model area for sustainable land use.
